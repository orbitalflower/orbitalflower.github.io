# orbitalflower.github.io

A personal web page. It was originally established in January 2015 as a blog to
grumble about state of computer security post-Snowden, but I came to appreciate
that other people were much better qualified to commentate on that field, and
pivoted to writing on my hobbies, mainly video games, tabletop roleplaying
games, and science fiction.

To establish your own site like this one, see the list of
[GitHub Pages Jekyll themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/) and the
documentation linked from that page.
