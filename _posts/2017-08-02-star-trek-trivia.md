Many thanks to [Memory Alpha](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/), the excellent
Star Trek reference wiki which provided a source for many of these interesting
facts, and [Memory Beta](http://memory-beta.wikia.com/), the wiki for Star Trek
extended universe.

## Extended universe shenanigans

I need to clarify that these are not parody. All of these things happen at some
point in one of the Star Trek novels or other apocrypha.

- Barclay is Captain Picard's bodyguard in the mirror universe. His genius and
  paranoia make him perfect for the job.
- Starfleet founds a secret black ops team named Active Four, consisting of Nog,
  Tuvok, and Thomas Riker.
- In the year 12,265, the Mega-Federation starship USS &Uuml;ber-Enterprise
  (NCC-1701-&infin;) sets off on a million year mission to explore new galaxies.
  The ship is a sphere of liquid-metal capable of travelling at Warp 1000, and
  it is jointly commanded by James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard. The crew turns
  out to consist entirely of holograms, except for Data, who eventually becomes
  human.
- Chakotay has a relationship with Janeway. When he later learns that Janeway
  was assimilated by the Borg, became their Queen, and was killed after a failed
  rescue attempt by Seven of Nine, Chakotay starts making poor command decisions
  and resigns from Starfleet. He later returns to Starfleet and is given command
  of the USS Voyager again. Janeway is restored to life by Kes and Q.
- A time-travelling Riker once found himself appearing on the Holodeck during
  one of Barclay's holodeck programs. Riker claimed to be a hologram programmed
  to tell Barclay off for using the holodeck too much. Barclay never used the
  holodeck again.
- Bashir is court-martialed and dishonourably discharged from Starfleet for
  fighting Section 31. It is commuted to an honourable discharge because he
  saved the entire Andorian race from extinction.
- In the original script for _Nemesis_, Geordi is in a relationship with Leah
  Brahms (the real Leah Brahms, not a hologram). It was cut when the actress
  wasn't available.
- Picard and Beverly Crusher marry and have a son, Rene Jacques Robert Francois
  Picard, who grows up and marries Riker and Troi's daughter, Natasha
  Riker-Troi.
- Grand Nagus Rom declared Quark's Bar the official Ferengi embassy to Bajor and
  made Quark an official Ferengi ambassador.
- Janeway, the holographic Doctor, Admiral Seven of Nine and the borg Hugh
  strike an alliance with the Borg to stop the Pah-wraiths from destroying the
  universe, by going back in time with the Guardian of Forever to destroy
  Bajor. They fail, but Sisko resets the timeline.
- The holographic Doctor accepts a commission in Starfleet with the rank of
  Lieutenant Commander.
- Kes fights B'Elanna Torres in a round of Anbo-Jutsu.

## It's a small universe

- Geordi LaForge left Starfleet to become a ship designer, then designed the
  ship Spock uses in the 2009 _Star Trek_ reboot movie.

- Hoshi Sato was one of the 4,000 people killed by Governor Kodos on Tarsus 4,
  the colony where James T. Kirk once lived.

  grandfather. They once took aboard Tobin Dax.
- Travis Mayweather served aboard Malcolm Reed's ship with Samuel Kirk.
- Trip, who is alive in the novels having faked his own death to work for
  Section 31, was teacher to the boy who would grow up to design the
  Constitution-class starships. He once visited Starfleet War Memorial on the
  same day as a young James T. Kirk.

## We have plenty of captains

Serving with Kirk, Picard, Sisko or Janeway turns out to be really good for your
career.

  of the USS Titan, and gets to keep his command when he becomes Admiral.
  In another timeline he captains the USS Sugihara.

## The cancelled Star Trek: Federation

After Star Trek: Enterprise, there was a brief proposal for a sequel set in the
year 3000 called [Star Trek: Federation](http://trekmovie.com/2011/04/16/exclusive-details-excerpts-from-star-trek-federation-series-proposal/).
It was quickly abandoned in favour of J. J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot movie, but
it was absolutely nuts. Here are my favourite parts:

- The main character is Lieutenant Commander Alexander Kirk, a descendant of
  James T. Kirk. He takes command of the new Enterprise after the captain and
  first officer are killed.
- The Federation has gotten corrupt and rubbish. A mysterious new alien destroys
  a Federation ship and new Kirk is the new survivor. Vulcan, Bajor and Betazed
  are so mad at Kirk's terrible description of the event that they immediately
  quit the Federation for some reason.
- The chief engineer is one of those gaseous species the Enterprise-D used to
  discover in nebulae and gas giants by accident, named The 76th Distillation of
  Blue.
- The doctor is a borg who can heal people with nanoprobes.
- There's a genetically advanced human officer, because apparently after a few
  centuries the Federation decided genetic manipulation is not a moral problem
  any more.
- The new Enterprise is powered by a micro-singularity like Romulan ships, and
  has a cloaking device like Romulan ships.
- The Romulans have finally re-unified with the Vulcans.
- The Cardassians have gone back to their spiritualist roots.
- The Klingons are wise warrior mystics, which I guess means they still fight
  but have stopped murdering their superiors to rise in ranks.
- The Ferengi now run the galaxy. Now that the Federation only have like twenty
  planets instead of 150+, capitalism is big again.

## Hachidan kiritsu, it's illegal!

There was a lot of overlap in the late eighties and early nineties between
science fiction fans and anime fans.

- The Anbo-Jutsu ring, where Riker fights his dad blindfolded with a padded
  stick, is covered in Japanese text, mostly anime references. This is easier to
  see in the remastered Blu-Ray release:
  - The main symbol in the middle means  _star_, as in Star Trek.
  - Barely visible but on either side of 'star' are _Lum_ and _Ataru_, the names
    of the main characters of Urusei Yatsura, an anime which ran from 1981
    to 1986. The kanji for 'star', pronounced 'sei', appears in the series title
    of Urusei Yatsura as a pun.
  - The scroll on the right wall says _urusai yatsura_, the same reference.
    'Urusai' means noisy or bothersome, with 'urusei' an alternate pronunciation
    of the same.
  - The word on the front right of the ring is _Yuri_, likely a reference to the
    the character Yuri from the anime Dirty Pair (1985). It's like that another
    side of the ring which cannot be seen says _Kei_, the other character.
- _Hoshi_, the name of the translator in Enterprise, also means 'star'.
- An on-screen reference is made to _Keiyurium_ in the TNG episode "Rascals".
  Another reference to Dirty Pair.
- A reference is made to dolphins aboard the Enterprise-D in the TNG episode
  "The Perfect Mate". It references Gunbuster (1988), a science fiction anime
  where the ship is piloted by dolphins.
- The Nausicaans, the race that stabbed Picard in the past, reference
  Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind, a 1984 anime.

## The Beta Quadrant Problem

A webpage titled [Star Trek Cartography](http://www.stdimension.org/int/Cartography/Voyager.htm)
charted the route Voyager took through the Delta Quadrant and predicted
(correctly) that it would end in Season 7 with a jump home because they'd never
reach the Beta Quadrant.

A big reason for this is that mention of the Beta Quadrant was taboo during Deep
Space Nine. As the Dominion were of the Gamme Quadrant, the Federation and all
its allies were referred to as the Alpha Quadrant races, even though several
are Beta Quadrant races (Vulcans, Klingons, Romulans). Earth is the dividing
line between the Alpha and Beta Quadrants.

But it sounds good to call the good guys the "alpha", much as Earth is referred
to as Sector 001, so they ran with it. In order to avoid shining a light on this
mess, Voyager had to avoid bringing up the topic of the Beta Quadrant as much as
possible.

Another reason is that that Voyager is the show about exploring the Delta
Quadrant, not the Beta Quadrant. It's about the new and unknown. When you hit
Beta Quadrant, it's about meeting the Romulans and Klingons again, which isn't
the point of Voyager.

Plus, as you get closer to Earth, you eventually reach the edges of Federation
space, or at least somewhere Starfleet has already explored. Then you either
declare "we're home" upon reaching some obscure border planet that isn't Earth,
or spend the rest of the series coasting through Federation space being greeted
as heroes. It would have been very anti-climactic.
