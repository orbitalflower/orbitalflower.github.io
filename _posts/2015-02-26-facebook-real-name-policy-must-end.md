Facebook's policy requiring members to use their real name is
unreasonable and bad for users. Here's why.
{:.lead}

## The "authentic name" policy is a lie

Facebook's stated policy completely contradicts their actual rules.

In 2014, Facebook's [Chris Cox stated](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/dear-facebook-sorry-start-now-lets-see-solutions):

> Our policy has never been to require everyone on Facebook to use their
> legal name. The spirit of our policy is that everyone on Facebook uses
> the authentic name they use in real life.

But as of February 2015, Facebook [only accepts legal name ID](https://www.facebook.com/help/159096464162185) as proof.

## Not everyone uses their legal name

Some people are better known by their stage name: Ringo Starr's authentic name
would be Ringo Starr, not Richard Starkey. "Mahatma" Gandhi's first name is an
honorific; his birth name was Mohandas. The name of programmer Moxie Marlinspike
is an alias.

Native Americans often have tribal names. Immigrants may take an unofficial
local name to fit in. Religious groups may give someone a new name upon
entering holy orders. Some people are better known to their friends by a
nickname.

Transgender people often adopt a new name to match the gender they choose to
live as. Some people have multiple names or change their name for cultural
reasons. Mitt Romney's real first name is Willard. Alexander Siddig's real
first name is Siddig.

Some women use a fake name to avoid abusive partners or stalkers. Some women
[pose as men](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/02/i-pretended-to-be-male-gamer/)
to avoid harassment. Children are warned not to use their real names online,
and may want to use an alias. Human rights activists may want to avoid
persecution. And some people have no legally registered name or just don't have
ID.

## The policy causes more harassment than it prevents

Although Facebook says its real name policy exists to prevent harassment,
it has the exact opposite effect. According to [a report by the EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/facebooks-name-policy-strikes-again-time-native-americans):

> Facebook doesn’t police names itself. It relies on reports from other users.

[And](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/dear-facebook-sorry-start-now-lets-see-solutions):

> There’s no question that the way Facebook’s system is implemented now is
> incredibly flawed and ripe for misuse. The enforcement mechanism has allowed
> abusive users to recreate the very online bullying the policy is supposed
> to prevent by going on reporting sprees.

Malicious users frequently abuse the system to report vulnerable or minority
groups, including children, transgender people and native Americans. Facebook's
real name policy directly empowers users to commit this harassment.

Conversely, the policy does nothing to stop reasonable-looking fake identities
with names like "John Smith". Nor is it necessary to stop spam, impersonation
or harassment, since these things are already against other rules and are easily
reported.

The real victims of Facebook's real name policy are not the bad actors Facebook
claims the policy was created to fight, but normal users, especially minorities
and the oppressed.
