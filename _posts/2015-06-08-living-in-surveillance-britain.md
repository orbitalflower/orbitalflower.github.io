The Guardian

Doctorow is absolutely right.

Earlier I wrote how the British government's justification of new powers as a
way to merely "maintain capability" [is
doublespeak](https://orbitalflower.github.io/20150604-intelligence-gap-is-doublespeak.html)
for "gaining new powers the government has never held". Thanks to technology,
secrecy and a disturbing lack of morals, the UK now has capabilities that
totalitarian Cold War police states could not even have dreamed of.

In fact, Doctorow may even be understating the issue.

## Surveillance Britain

In February 2014, Britain's GCHQ was caught recording images from private Yahoo
Messenger video chat worldwide. [The
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_Nerve_%28GCHQ%29) indiscriminately
targeted innocent people, UK citizens and foreign alike, spying on 1.8 million
accounts in six months. Between 3% and 11% contained nudity.

Anyone who engages in private chat has a natural expectation of privacy.
Traditionally in the UK, that right has been taken very seriously and may only
be broken by lawful authorities upon a warrant signed by a judge and based on
reasonable suspicion.

Yet a senior government MP signed off on a general warrant for a system that not
only records mostly innocent people, it records people _in the nude_.

As of February 2015, there are [19 such
warrants](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/05/what-to-look-out-for-britain-new-surveillance-bill)
in place, allowing similar wiretaps on all web traffic, phone, e-mail and more,
on the signature of an MP and with no judicial oversight. Broad [general
warrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ_of_assistance) like this were made
illegal in the United States under the Fourth Amendment, specifically to protect
against unreasonable search and seizure by British agents.

Unlike the United States, the United Kingdom has no written Constitution that
would invalidate bad laws. Britain as a country kind of grew organically over
hundreds of years, and at no point in time saw it necessary to officially codify
the moral standards of its people. This is perhaps for the better, given
Britain's history, and considering that several countries originally wrote their
Constitution specifically to rebel against the British Empire.

The result is that while US law is forced to comply with a strict code of moral
standards, the UK has no such system. The closest thing is the European
Convention on Human Rights, a treaty which the UK signed after World War II, but
a considerable number of British politicians want to leave the EU and abandon
this treaty altogether. So while the USA PATRIOT Act was shut down after being
ruled illegal, the UK has no equivalent domestic court with the same power.

## Spy cafe

In Doctorow's dystopia, he considers it unimaginable that a cafe would be
compelled to hide microphones in salt cellars to be activated upon court order.
He fears that Britain may one day apply such an egregious measure to the realm
of digital communications.

Britain has already long passed that point.

It has not hidden microphones, but hidden video cameras. It places them not only
in the public cafes, but in private bedrooms. And it activates them not on a
court order, but continuously and indefinitely, to the fullest extent that
technology allows, and without our consent.
