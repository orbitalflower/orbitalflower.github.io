The UK's Chief Surveillance Inspector responsible for oversight of the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) has admitted that the UK's
surveillance law is [flawed and lacks rigorous
oversight](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2015/10/13/surveillance-under-ripa-neither-a-strict-legal-framework-nor-rigorously-overseen-sam-lincoln/).

Unlike the US spy agencies, Britain's GCHQ is immune to Freedom of Information
requests and almost always replies to journalists' requests for information with
a familiar boilerplate response:

> It is long-standing policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters.
>
> All of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy
> framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and
> proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the
> secretary of state, the interception and intelligence services commissioners
> and the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee. All our operational
> processes rigorously support this position.

But in a recent article, the inspector reponsible for oversight disagrees:

> I was the Chief Surveillance Inspector at the Office of Surveillance
> Commissioners for eight years until August 2013. My own view is that the legal
> and policy framework is not strict and that oversight is not rigorous.
>
> In my view, RIPA is flawed because it is permissive legislation. Apart from an
> interception, no covert surveillance – the acquisition of communications data,
> intrusive or directed surveillance or the use of a covert human intelligence
> source ... – must be authorised before it can proceed (RIPA s.80). As Simon
> McKay (author of Covert Policing) correctly identifies, RIPA is essentially a
> “voluntary code”.

Under such a law, if the UK law enforcement or intelligence services wish to
covertly wiretap the entire national phone network as they have done, there is
no legal requirement for it to be "authorised".

The author further quotes the UK's current official legal definitions of
"covert" and "surveillance", which appear quite straightforward. This is
different to the US where, for example, a law requiring a warrant to collect
data is interpreted to allow unwarranted bulk collection simply by redefining
"collect" in a secret intelligence court so that data is not considered
"collected" until it is examined by an analyst.

The UK surveillance law needs no such trickery and just makes covert
surveillance without warrant outright legal. Surveillance is broadly defined as
a any observation or recording of a person or their communications, and it is
covert if done in a manner calculated to prevent the target from being aware of
it.

By that definition, it is clear that GCHQ engages in what UK law considers mass
surveillance of the entire nation and an unlimited number of foreign citizens
whose data passes through the UK or its listening points.

This didn't change when the Snowden leaks revealed the existence of GCHQ's
surveillance programmes. By definition, the fact that they continue to operate
secretly (in some cases the highest levels of top secret classification) and
that GCHQ refuses to even comment on their existence, means that what they're
doing is covert. That they collect such data on a national scale defines it
clearly as mass surveillance.

Note that the GCHQ boilerplate statement make no reference to human rights or
privacy. They claim only that what they're doing is legal and "necessary",
presumably meaning necessary to achieve their own (classified) goals.

Protecting human rights is not one of those goals. This is radically different
to the UK's police force, who take their responsibility to protect human rights
seriously, and whose success or failure at this is subject to public scrutiny. 

GCHQ views human rights legislation as an impediment to its work, and typically
applies only a thin veneer or human rights measures in order to make token
compliance with a minimum of restriction to their work. What they do would not
be considered human rights.

Take the OPTIC NERVE programme, which [recorded private Yahoo webcam
conversations](https://orbitalflower.github.io/20150701-terrorism-again-used-to-justify-anti-privacy-laws.html)
for 1.8 million users, including between 3% and 11% which contain nudity. Yahoo
called this "a whole new level of violation of our users' privacy", and
moved to encrypted communications to protect British users from their own
government as a result.

Storing this much video in the long term would be extremely expensive, and it's
a fair bet that this was a factor when they decided to limit storage to one
video frame per five minutes.

But GCHQ made the outrageous claim that this limited storage was done to
preserve the human right to privacy, and that this was sufficient for the
programme to comply with that right. GCHQ's internal compliance officers were
clearly so out of touch with the real world and unafraid of meaningful oversight
that they signed off on this ridiculous compliance measure.

Nobody reasonable person would accept the line GCHQ has drawn here. Britain
hacked Yahoo and took screenshots thousands of innocent people's private
cybersex sessions. Many consider it a violation of privacy even for consensual
cybersex partners to take screenshots of without permission, and it is a crime
in the UK to do the same to an unwitting victim. Yet here the government sees
fit to do this to their own citizens en masse.

We are talking about a system that Yahoo called not only a violation of privacy,
but an unprecedented new _level_ of violation, and GCHQ was able to convince its
oversight committee that this was in keeping with citizens' Article 8 privacy
rights.

The former Chief Surveillance Inspector is right. GCHQ does not operate under
effective oversight, and are wrong to claim otherwise.
