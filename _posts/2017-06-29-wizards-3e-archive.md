#### Revision Spotlight

Original index: [Revision Spotlight](https://web.archive.org/web/2016/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rsa/archive)

An explanation of the changes between D&D 3.0 and 3.5. Monte Cook once said that
D&D 3.5 made too many small and confusing changes, and the length of this
FAQ supports this.

Although the individual articles for this category are still online, the
original index link has compiled all articles into one long article for
convenience.

## Notes

During the D&D 4th edition era, Wizards of the Coast stopped the practice of
distributing massive amounts of free D&D material on their site, instead
channelling that effort into the _D&D Insider_ paid service. Gratefully, they
allowed an archive of the 3rd edition D&D content to stay online.

After the launch of D&D 5th edition, the 3e archive was kept online but moved
from _www.wizards.com_ to _archive.wizards.com_. This had the result of breaking
links around the web, since they didn't set up redirects for the thousands of
old URLs. HTTPS URLs would also attempt to redirect to the main site and fail.

As of 2017-06-29, the subdirectory /dnd/ was blocked by robots.txt on both
_www.wizards.com_ and _archive.wizards.com_. This had the result of blocking
many articles from the Wayback Machine, generally older articles from before
April 2003. Fortunately, when Wizards failed to maintain the old site in 2022,
they also failed to maintain the robots.txt files, meaning that those pages are
retained in the Wayback Machine.

A few pieces of the old site are no longer online. These are mainly the Original
Adventures and the free AD&D book downloads. Many of these were released for
sale when WotC discovered they could sell out-of-print titles in ebook format.
Later they would pull all ebooks from retailers over piracy fears, frustrating
some users who had already paid for books but not downloaded them. Fourth
edition was a weird time for D&D.

Around 2022, Wizards of the Coast took _archive.wizards.com_ offline. I've
replaced the URLs here with archived versions from The Wayback Machine.
