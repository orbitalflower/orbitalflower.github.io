## Philosophy of D&D

> The major appeal of the FRPG is the fantastic, the assumption of a character
> role in a world filled with strange creatures, and by dint of effort building
> through deeds of action and intellect that game persona from a lowly
> adventurer to a renown figure with power and prestiege in his milieu. there is
> little satisfaction in such accomplishment if it isn't earned.
>
> The basis for the D&D game, including 3E and 3.5E is not the superheroic, but
> the heroic.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 8, 2005

> __Q:__ What do you consider the soul/spirit/heart of D&D as you wrote it?
>
> __Gary:__ In as few words as possible:
>
> - Absolute authority of the DM, rules lawyers given the boot
> - Rule books seldom used by a competant DM
> - Action and adventure in play
> - Swords & sorcery, not comic book superhero genre material
> - Group co-operation paramount for success
> - Freedom to extemporize and innovate for all participants
> - Reliance on architypical models for characters
> - Fellowship of those participating
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

> About all I care to venture here is that a good RPGer has the following traits:
>
> - Extroverted in regards playing
> - Knowledge of the genre and his character's role
> - Playing to have fun with comrades
> - Pays attention to the GM
> - Knows and enjoys many things outside of gaming
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 8, 2005

> I'll take a stab at the five elements that make a game session enjoyable:
>
> 1. Good personal relationships between all the participants.
> 2. Subject matter that interests the whole group.
> 3. Able GMing, including animated participationby that one.
> 4. Able play, role-assumption, and roleplaying by the players.
> 5. A sense of danger from the environment, but knowledge that clever play will
>    likely overcome all hazards,
> 6. In-game reward for characters played successfully in the scenario,
> 7. Shared recounting of the adventure at its conclusion.
> 8. A conclusion that opens the portal to yet more exciting possibilities for
>    play.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

> I believe that the first quality a dungeon needs is game logic and
> verisimilitude based thereon. That's why I subsumed the maze beneath Greyhawk
> Castle had been created by a mad demi-god.
>
> The elements needed thereafter are: Challenge of exploration, increasing
> danger including actual PC loss, varied problems, varied environments,
> occassional humor or like relief from the tension normal to the environment,
> mysteries, rewards commensurate with the challenge overcome, a series of
> milestones indicating achievement in the course of delving into the labyrinth,
> and a finally where the successful PC(s) get the big reward for staying the
> course and reaching the untimate conclusion.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 3, 2003

> Those who reject the dungeon crawl are like painters who refuse to use red
> pigment in their work. This leaves their palette lacking in a primary color.
>
> --- Dragon #272, _Hooray for the Dungeon Crawl!_, June 2000

### Roleplaying vs roll-playing

> Many people knock "roll-playing," but it is a necessary part of the PRG game
> form where chance is a major factor in the game--as it is in real life. The
> real bad rap against dice rolling is if combat is the predominate feature of
> play, that negating the other elements that make up the game...such as
> role-playing.
>
> Rules are necessary for a structured game, doubly so when it is based on
> fantasy where no real facts are available to the participants. then the
> structure becomes the major feature of play, though, then it is at least as
> onerous as roll-playing, so both terms are equally daming. If a game is
> nothing but role-playing, then it is not really a RPG, but some form of
> improvisational theater, for the game form includes far more than acting out
> assumed roles.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 3, 2003

> "Storytelling" games are not RPGs. Neither are "diceless" games.
>
> An RPG creates a story, does not follow a script. That's a play, possibly
> improv theater. In a real RPG the GM develops a backstory and plot, sets the
> scenes, and then the PCs interact with those and by their actions create the
> actual tale, the events and conclusion of which are indeterminate until that
> occurs.
>
> As in real life, chance and random occurrances must be a part of an RPG
> adventure. As a matter of fact you and I do not know what will happen in the
> next minute. As is oft quoted, "There's many a slip between cup and lip." to
> ignore random events, not allow chance into play, is to consign the game to
> predestination. 
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2003

> As false to the game form as the pre-scripted “story,” is play that has little
> more in it than seek and destroy missions, vacuous effort where the
> participants fight and kill some monster so as to gain more power and thus be
> able to look for yet more potent opponents in a spiral that leads nowhere save
> eventual boredom. So pure hack and slash play is anathema to me too.
>
> Tactical, and strategic, play is a fine addition to the RPG, and if it is
> in-character, something I see as desirable, In this category fall such things
> as exploration, economics, politics, and even intrigue.
>

### Ignoring rules

> My belief is that the rules for an RPG should facilitate the enjoyment of the
> game for all concerned. If they get in the way then they are no good.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> Play is mainly reliant on rules. I ignored those I write when DMing if the
> game called for that, and in all added what was logical in terms of the game
> environment to play. Thus much of adventuring was not "by the book," but
> rather seat of the pants play by DM and players alike.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> BTW, when I am DMing AD&D, I tend to ignore rules that get in the wat of the
> flow of the game.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> ... the more rules one must pay close attention to, the more difficult it is
> to create adventure material.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> Every complication demands more rules and explanations, more time spent
> resolving combat, that's fine for a military or dueling simulation, but not in
> an RPG where there are so many other things to do besides killing things ;-)
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

### Lethality

> Nobody seems to know what "Gygaxian" means. I sure don't after perusing the
> lot. there's a considerable amount of confusion in regards to my DMing style,
> and not a few people there blowing hard without having an inkling of what it
> is like.
>
> If I set out to kill PCs, how on earth did Tenser, Robilar, and the rest ever
> get to relatively high levels? What the whiners don't like are adventure
> situations where they lose their PCs due to their own inept play. My modules
> don't suffer fools lightly :-D 
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 4, 2003

> Do I enjoy killing PCs when I GM? A The answer is definately not in the least,
> especially if they belong to regular players. there I do all I can to prevent
> such loss without directly intervening in players' actions for their
> characters.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

> How I detest namby-pamby whiners that expect to play a real RPG without threat
> of character death or loss of a level, stat points, or even choice magic
> items! Without such possibilities, what it the purpose of play, a race to see
> which character can have the greatest level, highest stats, and largest horde
> of treasure?
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 7, 2005

> If some players find the rules too deadly for the characters I suggest that
> the characters' players are not very skilled not given to thinking before
> acting. That stated, PC death is meant to occur even when the best of players
> are concerned, but that is what cleric spells and wishes are meant to
> mitigate.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

### Realism

> There is indeed a need for lethality in a single successful attack when
> simulation of actual combat is desired. That is why I have stayed away from it
> in the combat systems I have devised for my fantasy RPG designs, (On the old
> Boot Hill game one could get a character killed in a single exchange of
> gunfire.) As combat is the most popular activity in the RPG game form, it is
> pretty well necessary to allow for plenty of it, so...
>
> Realism when one deals with magic, fantastic beasts, and all that makes up the
> FRPG seems a marginal concept to me. Verisimilitude is another matter, but the
> basis for play is improbablity. If the fantastic premises can be accepted,
> then quibbles about realism within the forum of play have more to do with
> perception than actuality.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

### Prewritten vs on-the-fly

> The main difference between formal creation of material and doing it as one
> serves in the role of GM is spontenaity, that allowing the material created on
> the spot to beter suit the player group ad the situation at hand.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 9, 2005

> All the outdoor adventures I ran, and most of the dungeon crawls were half or
> more made up on the spot.
>
> When extemporizing, the GM must be prepared to handle all manner of unexpected
> actions by the players. If they are foolish, I always invent a number of
> opportunities for disaster. If the course taken is one that is clever and
> innovative, I add in rewards.
>
> Before a party goes off on a likley disasterous course I will try to deter
> them from such action--wandering monsters have much usefulness in this regard.
>
> As for "railroading," there are some scenarios where a bit of that is
> absolutely necessary to further the whole of the adventure. This is not to say
> that an entire adventure should be linear and force the party into a situation
> with a foregone conclusion. The use of a predetermined outcome should be only
> to set up an interesting and challenging scenario where the players are
> absolutely free to manage the outcome on their own, that outcome offering
> penalties for wrong decisions, rewards for correct ones, large rewards for
> innovation and creative solutions ;-) 
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 4, 2003

### Player/character divide

> Finally, there is no distinction between "having a PC figure something out"
> and the player doing so ... the two are not separate entities, as the player
> is making believe he is the game character.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 10, 2006

> Who can say what a PC knws and doesn't know aboit the world he lives in? if
> it's something that could be known, then there's no metagaming involved.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

### Miniatures

> I have nothing against the use of miniatures, but they are generally
> impractical for long and free-wheeling campaign play where the scene and
> opponents can vary wildly in the course of but an hour.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 4, 2003

> In fact you will not even need miniature figures, although their occasional
> employment is recommended for real spectacle when battles are fought.
>
> --- Foreword, _Dungeons & Dragons_, 1973

## The origins of D&D

> __Q:__ What inspired you to create roleplaying?
>
> __Gary:__ Some 30 years of living prior to actually sitting down and writing
> the first draft (50 pages in length) all combined to bring about the resulting
> game. It was a combination of much reading of imaginative fiction, a love of
> games, and the desire to create that enables it.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> When someone looks for the roots of the PRG, then need only harken to "Let's
> Pretend" and games such as "Cops & Robbers" to find them :-D
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> We started playing man-to-man games around 1968, with several players on each
> side and a command figure for each. From there it was a short step to one
> figure per player. Note that there was still a lot of stress on hiring
> men-at-arms in OD&D, though ;-)
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 7, 2005

> What with command figures and the rules, individual figure play was not
> startling. When heroes, superheroes, and wizards were considered in the
> "Fantasy supplement," the concept of a player with but a single figure on the
> table born.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 9, 2005

> No game I had played before I devised the Man-to-Man rules for the Chainmail
> rules book influenced that design. I made it all up off the top of my head,
> just as I did the Fantasy Rules section. Inspirational sources were historical
> for the former, mythical for the latter.
>
> It is noteworthy, though, that the radius of a fireball and the stroke of a
> lightning bolt corresponded to a heacy catapult's area of attack effect and
> that of a cannon in the 1:20 Chainmail rules.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

> There is no question that I wrote every word of the original D&D game. Dave
> Arneson has said so himself in an interview in the now-defunct magazine
> Different worlds (issue #3, as I recall).
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 2, 2003

> The initial 50 page draft of what was to become the D&D game took me only
> about two weeks to write--around November of 1972. After all, most of the
> material was drawn from the CHAINMAIL Fantasy Supplement, so it wasn't a real
> challenge.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> Sadly, I have lost the original ms. copies for what became the D&D game, the
> initial c. 50 pp. (1972) one and the later 150 pp, (1973) one. I understand
> that at least one copy of one of them exists, but where I can't say. My
> original copy of the second draft went to the printers, and from it came the
> original D&D game's three booklets. I never recovered the ms. from the printer
> :-(
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> Look at my recommended reading list in the old DMG again, amigo. Both Howard
> and Lovecraft are named there and were actually major influences on my
> creation of the game.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> __Q:__ How and why did you decide to use 1d20 as the randomizer for the
> alternate combat system and saving throw charts in D&D in place of the 2d6
> rolls used in Chainmail?
>
> __Gary:__ The 5% incriment (20) probability curve was used in the WW II
> military miniatures rules set, Tractics, that I co-authored with Leon Tucker
> and Mike Reese. tucker originally wanted a 1-100 spread, and Reese had used
> something like that using two d6 for one of his rules sets. the desire for
> different curves was pretty common by the time I authored D&D.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 7, 2005

> When the D&D game was published, we bought 50 sets of these dice from school
> supply company, got a 10% discount, and passed them along to gamers at $3.50
> per set--a break even price--so as to make the D&D game easily playable. The
> school supply couldn't believe that we were ordering so many sets, and when we
> asked for discount rate on 1,000, they declined, so we found their source in
> the Orient and ordered direct from them.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2004

> As for the traps, we originally played dungeon crawls much of the time. My
> dungeon levels were both an exploration/mapping problem to solve and a place
> for encounters. As I would place perhaps 15 or so active encounters on a level
> of many passagerways and as many as 50 or so rooms, to keep things
> "interesting" I'd include various traps. That became a de rigeur thing in
> general from around 1977 on.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> _(on the origin of the planes:)_ I used the alchemical for the elemental
> planes, the old concept of the elheral plane, ideas drawn from the
> Spiritualist writers of the 19th century, along with mythology. For example,
> Ancient Egyptian religious belief had an upper realm, Pet, and a lower one,
> the Duat or Tuat, something that combined areas of a material paradise,
> uncertain realms, and hellish places.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

## Game mechanics

### Alignment

> When players began to announce their character's alignment to other
> participants I shuddered. I suggested that such information was not for
> broadcast, that the PCs might not actually think of themselves as categorized
> thus, and the alignment categories were meant more to guide the player in
> playing his character in the game.
>
> As for alignment language, I assumed that it was akin to Latin in regard to
> use. ... Somehow I supposed that DMs would arrive at similar conclusions unaided.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 8, 2005

> An alignment language is promarily keyed to the religious subjects that would
> be discussed or read about by those of that persuation. One might think of
> such a tingue as being similar to Latin for Roman Catholics or Hebrew for
> Jews.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

> As I have pointed out at times, a Paladin might well execute a group of
> captives after they have converted from their former (Evil) alignment to
> Lawful Good, for that act saves their sould, prevents them from slipping back
> into error.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2004

### Armor class and HP

> While AC increases mainly by the wearing of superior protectionm HPs increase
> with the character's accumulating experience in combat reflected by level
> increase.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

### Campaigns

> Indeed, i assumed no campaign with an end but connected episodes, with
> occassional sagas such as the G and D series of adventures. When PCs got to
> around 15th level they were generally retired, went only on special
> adventures.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 4, 2003

### Level drain

> the vampire's level drain came from me. I decided upon it as a way of
> simulating that monster's capacity to weaken and make helpless its victims.
> Once established, the level-draining attack power made all undead so able into
> most fearsome opponents B-)
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

> As an aside, level draining is less cruel that house rules I have heard about
> that cause loss of sight or appendages.
> 
> You pegged the reason for my adding that to the system. The threat is potent,
> yet does not actually kill the PC. There is even a clerical restoration
> possible, that costing much in the way of monetary and magical items likely,
> thus getting them out of play and giving more reason to PC to keep
> adventuring.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 7, 2005

> Next those cry babies will be moaning about being turned to stone.
> Tell the complainers they should be playing a CRPG where they can save and
> thus avoid all real danger--ues cheat codes too :-D
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2004

### Percentile strength

> Adding a d% roll to an 18 Strength roll is hardly complicated. It was done
> because Strength was the only stat that needed to be increased in steps by the
> d% mechanic so as to improve fighters to hit and damage chances. So that was
> used because I favor interesting play over any imagined elegance, that being
> quite unlikely in an RPG in my view. ...
>
> Can you imaging the increases of stats going into the 20s needed in order to
> get the same result as 18/00? The human norm bell curve of 3-18 down the tubes
> in a jiffy. Not elegant at all, and simply foolish ;-)
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2004

### Vancian spellcasting

> The "memorize then fire and forget" principal for casting spells Jack Vance
> assumed in his fantasy stories seemed perfect to me for use by D&D
> magic-users. IT required forethought by the player and limited the power of
> the class all at once.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

> The low-level magic-user is mainly a one- or two-shot weapon, but the
> "artillery" is potent. This fits well with a balanced party of low-level PCs,
> none of wom are really very strong singly.
>
> I chose to use a system of magic inspired by the worls of Jack Vance because
> it fit the whole of the game I devised. For example, think of an archer with a
> quiver of arrows. When one is shot, it is gone. Magic spells, more potent than
> arrows, are much the same.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> Yes, I did intend to have schools of magic based on the types of spells as you
> note above. The m-u would begin with one specialization, but at verious points
> along the level progression ladder he could opt to add a new field or
> intensify his capacity in the original one. This was meant to make m-us
> interesting beyond the point where they could use 9th level spells, any
> diversion from specialization delaying the advanced spell level possession but
> adding new lower level spells of a new school.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

## Character classes

> In seeking clear class distinctions I did indeed proscribe m-us from the use
> of the sword, and clerics too. This made the archetypes distinct, balanced the
> character classes, and worked well enough for game purposes, methinks.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> Remember that I modeled the cleric class on Bishop Odo and Friar Tuck...both
> able combatants ;-) 
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

> The Thief was based on Jack of Shadows (Zelazny) and Cugel (Vance) with a
> touch of REH's Conan, rather than solely on the Gray Mouser. Mouser was too
> good a swordsman to serve as the pure model.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2004

> __Q:__ Why did the original bard require Rogue? _[thief]_
>
> __Gary:__  I included that as most fictional treatments of bard-like
> characters were roguish, engaged in some nefarious activity such as stealing.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> The illusionist sub-class sprang from my reading. So many spellworkers in
> fable and fiction used only the illusory, not "real magic" that had actual
> substance and effect, that I thought it would be fun to include such an option
> in the game.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> As far as I am concerned, the Paladin is Lawful Good--perior. The class takes
> vows, swears an oath, and then follows it. The concept is drawn from some
> legend--Authurian--and some quasi-legend--the paladins of Charlemaine plus the
> code of chivalry as it was written, more honored in the breach than the
> keeping.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> The Ranger class was originally devised by Joe Fischer, then a regular in my
> D&D game group. I published his initial treatment of the class in The
> Strategic Review, thereafter revised it and included it in the core game
> rules. Of course it is apparent that Joe based the class on JRRT's work and
> Aragorn.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2004

> The cavalier class was created mainly because all noble warriors were not in
> the same stamp as Sir Galahad and Roland.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 9, 2005

> All of the titles for the Monk Class were taken unabashedly from mah jjong,
> one of my favorite games. As flowers are honors tiles, delicate and beautiful,
> I thought it fitted well with an Eastern aesthetic martial artist, the object
> belying his actual prowess.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

> __Q:__ Why do druids use scimitars?
>
> __Gary:__ It is because the scimitar is as close a sword weapon I could come
> up with to match the druids' mistletoe-harvesting sickle.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 12, 2006

> The primary appeal of the Druid class from a creative standpoint is that the
> Romans were so thorough in destroying them and their religion that we know
> virtually nothing about either :-o
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 12, 2006

## Races

> I guess it's no secret that I am not a rabid fan of the "Rings Trilogy," so
> that should explain a good bit of why elves in D&D are more my conception of
> them than they are copies after what the Good Professor Tolkien saw them as
> ;-) My take was more of the British mythology based, with French "feys" the
> influence for the high elves.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 2, 2003

> Later on I added gnomes to D&D to broaden the choices for non-human PCs, as I
> did in AD&D. This was done because a number of players, myself included, were
> tired of having so many dwarves, elves, and halflings in the group of
> adventurers.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2004

## Monsters

> __Q:__ Someone asked what the first ever monster in a dungeon was (going back
> to the preliminary phases of the game ages ago) and what its final fate was.
>
> __Gary:__ The monsters first encountered, by son Ernie's and daughter Elise's
> characters, were a nest of scorpions in some rubble in the very first room of
> the dungeon they entered. The glint of coins was mentioned to lure the
> incautious hand into attack proximity, but Elise's PC used a dagger to poke
> around, and the scorpions were spotted. Eventually one managed to sting, but
> the poison saving throw was made. They next encountered and defeated a gang of
> kobolds with a chest of 3,000 copper pieces. Needless to say, they weren't
> pleased with the treasure.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2004

### Celestials

> Devas were drawn mainly from mytholology. Planetar and Solar were inspired by
> Theosophy.
>
> ... I don't believe that solar symbols are connected to the supposed
> Theophysical Solar spirit creatire. a sort of thing similar to a Seraph, just
> as the Planatar is rougly equivalent to a Cherub.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

### Dragons

> If you read the intro to the SLAYER'S GUIDE TO DRAGONS fromMongoose, you'll
> see therein how I came up with the chromatic dragons. Some colors other than
> red were needed, hues that would be harmonious with their breath wespons. When
> I'd done the four new additions to the CHAINMAIL red dragon, it seemed a good
> plan to have a LG dragon, one of gold color that was based on the Oriental
> model. From that I worked on the rest of the metallic species.
>

(NOTE: The episode referenced is _Kolchak: The Night Stalker_ episode 11,
"Horror on the Heights". It aired on December 20, 1974. According to
[the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcmRZuhSLXQ&t=35m19s)
"A crossbow is the method described in legend by which one may destroy
a Rakshasa, with arrows blessed by the divine Brahma himself.")

## Editions of D&D

### OD&D

### AD&D

## Sources

__Note:__ Several of these quotes date back to a series of thirteen Q&A
threads on the ENWorld forum between 2002 and 2008. In 2015, these were
compiled into single massive thread, titled
[Q&A with Gary Gygax](http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?22566-Q-amp-A-with-Gary-Gygax).
Regrettably, many links to the original threads are now broken.

In 2011, _Blog of Holding_ collected all of Gary's Q&A replies
[into one page](http://blogofholding.com/?p=2761). Unfortunately, this was
since taken down and made into a book, _Cheers, Gary_, which at time of
writing appears to be out of print.
