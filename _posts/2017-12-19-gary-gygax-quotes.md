## Philosophy of D&D

> The major appeal of the FRPG is the fantastic, the assumption of a character
> role in a world filled with strange creatures, and by dint of effort building
> through deeds of action and intellect that game persona from a lowly
> adventurer to a renown figure with power and prestiege in his milieu. there is
> little satisfaction in such accomplishment if it isn't earned.
>
> The basis for the D&D game, including 3E and 3.5E is not the superheroic, but
> the heroic.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 8, 2005

> __Q:__ What do you consider the soul/spirit/heart of D&D as you wrote it?
>
> __Gary:__ In as few words as possible:
>
> - Absolute authority of the DM, rules lawyers given the boot
> - Rule books seldom used by a competant DM
> - Action and adventure in play
> - Swords & sorcery, not comic book superhero genre material
> - Group co-operation paramount for success
> - Freedom to extemporize and innovate for all participants
> - Reliance on architypical models for characters
> - Fellowship of those participating
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

> About all I care to venture here is that a good RPGer has the following traits:
>
> - Extroverted in regards playing
> - Knowledge of the genre and his character's role
> - Playing to have fun with comrades
> - Pays attention to the GM
> - Knows and enjoys many things outside of gaming
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 8, 2005

> I'll take a stab at the five elements that make a game session enjoyable:
>
> 1. Good personal relationships between all the participants.
> 2. Subject matter that interests the whole group.
> 3. Able GMing, including animated participationby that one.
> 4. Able play, role-assumption, and roleplaying by the players.
> 5. A sense of danger from the environment, but knowledge that clever play will
>    likely overcome all hazards,
> 6. In-game reward for characters played successfully in the scenario,
> 7. Shared recounting of the adventure at its conclusion.
> 8. A conclusion that opens the portal to yet more exciting possibilities for
>    play.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

> I believe that the first quality a dungeon needs is game logic and
> verisimilitude based thereon. That's why I subsumed the maze beneath Greyhawk
> Castle had been created by a mad demi-god.
>
> The elements needed thereafter are: Challenge of exploration, increasing
> danger including actual PC loss, varied problems, varied environments,
> occassional humor or like relief from the tension normal to the environment,
> mysteries, rewards commensurate with the challenge overcome, a series of
> milestones indicating achievement in the course of delving into the labyrinth,
> and a finally where the successful PC(s) get the big reward for staying the
> course and reaching the untimate conclusion.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 3, 2003

> Those who reject the dungeon crawl are like painters who refuse to use red
> pigment in their work. This leaves their palette lacking in a primary color.
>
> --- Dragon #272, _Hooray for the Dungeon Crawl!_, June 2000

> As for a story, that's an adjunct to the "adventure" the PCs experience. the
> players and the GM do create something than might be a story dull or exciting,
> dramatic or comedic....if it were written or told after the fact. that isn't
> the aim of the game though. An RPG is to enterain and amuse the participants
> through play.

### Roleplaying vs roll-playing

> Many people knock "roll-playing," but it is a necessary part of the PRG game
> form where chance is a major factor in the game--as it is in real life. The
> real bad rap against dice rolling is if combat is the predominate feature of
> play, that negating the other elements that make up the game...such as
> role-playing.
>
> Rules are necessary for a structured game, doubly so when it is based on
> fantasy where no real facts are available to the participants. then the
> structure becomes the major feature of play, though, then it is at least as
> onerous as roll-playing, so both terms are equally daming. If a game is
> nothing but role-playing, then it is not really a RPG, but some form of
> improvisational theater, for the game form includes far more than acting out
> assumed roles.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 3, 2003

> "Storytelling" games are not RPGs. Neither are "diceless" games.
>
> An RPG creates a story, does not follow a script. That's a play, possibly
> improv theater. In a real RPG the GM develops a backstory and plot, sets the
> scenes, and then the PCs interact with those and by their actions create the
> actual tale, the events and conclusion of which are indeterminate until that
> occurs.
>
> As in real life, chance and random occurrances must be a part of an RPG
> adventure. As a matter of fact you and I do not know what will happen in the
> next minute. As is oft quoted, "There's many a slip between cup and lip." to
> ignore random events, not allow chance into play, is to consign the game to
> predestination. 
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2003

> As false to the game form as the pre-scripted “story,” is play that has little
> more in it than seek and destroy missions, vacuous effort where the
> participants fight and kill some monster so as to gain more power and thus be
> able to look for yet more potent opponents in a spiral that leads nowhere save
> eventual boredom. So pure hack and slash play is anathema to me too.
>
> Tactical, and strategic, play is a fine addition to the RPG, and if it is
> in-character, something I see as desirable, In this category fall such things
> as exploration, economics, politics, and even intrigue.
>
> --- [The Dungeon Master: An Interview with Gary Gygax](http://www.witchboy.net/articles/the-dungeon-master-an-interview-with-gary-gygax/)

### Ignoring rules

> My belief is that the rules for an RPG should facilitate the enjoyment of the
> game for all concerned. If they get in the way then they are no good.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> Play is mainly reliant on rules. I ignored those I write when DMing if the
> game called for that, and in all added what was logical in terms of the game
> environment to play. Thus much of adventuring was not "by the book," but
> rather seat of the pants play by DM and players alike.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> BTW, when I am DMing AD&D, I tend to ignore rules that get in the wat of the
> flow of the game.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> ... the more rules one must pay close attention to, the more difficult it is
> to create adventure material.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 1, 2002

> Every complication demands more rules and explanations, more time spent
> resolving combat, that's fine for a military or dueling simulation, but not in
> an RPG where there are so many other things to do besides killing things ;-)
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

### Lethality

> Nobody seems to know what "Gygaxian" means. I sure don't after perusing the
> lot. there's a considerable amount of confusion in regards to my DMing style,
> and not a few people there blowing hard without having an inkling of what it
> is like.
>
> If I set out to kill PCs, how on earth did Tenser, Robilar, and the rest ever
> get to relatively high levels? What the whiners don't like are adventure
> situations where they lose their PCs due to their own inept play. My modules
> don't suffer fools lightly :-D 
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 4, 2003

> Do I enjoy killing PCs when I GM? A The answer is definately not in the least,
> especially if they belong to regular players. there I do all I can to prevent
> such loss without directly intervening in players' actions for their
> characters.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

> How I detest namby-pamby whiners that expect to play a real RPG without threat
> of character death or loss of a level, stat points, or even choice magic
> items! Without such possibilities, what it the purpose of play, a race to see
> which character can have the greatest level, highest stats, and largest horde
> of treasure?
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 7, 2005

> If some players find the rules too deadly for the characters I suggest that
> the characters' players are not very skilled not given to thinking before
> acting. That stated, PC death is meant to occur even when the best of players
> are concerned, but that is what cleric spells and wishes are meant to
> mitigate.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

### Realism

> There is indeed a need for lethality in a single successful attack when
> simulation of actual combat is desired. That is why I have stayed away from it
> in the combat systems I have devised for my fantasy RPG designs, (On the old
> Boot Hill game one could get a character killed in a single exchange of
> gunfire.) As combat is the most popular activity in the RPG game form, it is
> pretty well necessary to allow for plenty of it, so...
>
> Realism when one deals with magic, fantastic beasts, and all that makes up the
> FRPG seems a marginal concept to me. Verisimilitude is another matter, but the
> basis for play is improbablity. If the fantastic premises can be accepted,
> then quibbles about realism within the forum of play have more to do with
> perception than actuality.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

### Prewritten vs on-the-fly

> The main difference between formal creation of material and doing it as one
> serves in the role of GM is spontenaity, that allowing the material created on
> the spot to beter suit the player group ad the situation at hand.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 9, 2005

> All the outdoor adventures I ran, and most of the dungeon crawls were half or
> more made up on the spot.
>
> When extemporizing, the GM must be prepared to handle all manner of unexpected
> actions by the players. If they are foolish, I always invent a number of
> opportunities for disaster. If the course taken is one that is clever and
> innovative, I add in rewards.
>
> Before a party goes off on a likley disasterous course I will try to deter
> them from such action--wandering monsters have much usefulness in this regard.
>
> As for "railroading," there are some scenarios where a bit of that is
> absolutely necessary to further the whole of the adventure. This is not to say
> that an entire adventure should be linear and force the party into a situation
> with a foregone conclusion. The use of a predetermined outcome should be only
> to set up an interesting and challenging scenario where the players are
> absolutely free to manage the outcome on their own, that outcome offering
> penalties for wrong decisions, rewards for correct ones, large rewards for
> innovation and creative solutions ;-) 
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 4, 2003

> _In response to a request to publish his original campaign notes_
>
> There is no earthly use to most GMs for reproductions of sloppily hand-drawn
> maps and one-line encounter notes, other than to say thay have a copy. The
> heart of all the adventures in those dungeons was improvisation.
>

### Player/character divide

> Finally, there is no distinction between "having a PC figure something out"
> and the player doing so ... the two are not separate entities, as the player
> is making believe he is the game character.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 10, 2006

> Who can say what a PC knws and doesn't know aboit the world he lives in? if
> it's something that could be known, then there's no metagaming involved.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 6, 2004

### Miniatures

> I have nothing against the use of miniatures, but they are generally
> impractical for long and free-wheeling campaign play where the scene and
> opponents can vary wildly in the course of but an hour.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 4, 2003

> In fact you will not even need miniature figures, although their occasional
> employment is recommended for real spectacle when battles are fought.
>
> --- Foreword, _Dungeons & Dragons_, 1973

### Fudging

> If mere chance is the cause of the impending failure, I modify the situation
> to have the adversarial side be likewise blighted by ill fortune. If I
> over-powered the NPCs/monsters I do indeed reduce these capacities in some way
> so as to enable the party to uscceed.
>
> In the case of sheer foolish play on the part of the players, I let the chips
> fall where they may, and if that means new Avatars, that's the breaks

## The origins of D&D

> __Q:__ What inspired you to create roleplaying?
>
> __Gary:__ Some 30 years of living prior to actually sitting down and writing

> We played with my toy soldiers and 54 mm figurines regularly from c. 1950

## Game mechanics

### Alignment

> When players began to announce their character's alignment to other
> participants I shuddered. I suggested that such information was not for
> broadcast, that the PCs might not actually think of themselves as categorized
> thus, and the alignment categories were meant more to guide the player in
> playing his character in the game.
>
> As for alignment language, I assumed that it was akin to Latin in regard to
> use. ... Somehow I supposed that DMs would arrive at similar conclusions unaided.
>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 8, 2005

> An alignment language is promarily keyed to the religious subjects that would
> be discussed or read about by those of that persuation. One might think of
> such a tingue as being similar to Latin for Roman Catholics or Hebrew for
> Jews.

> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 13, 2007

> As I have pointed out at times, a Paladin might well execute a group of

>
> --- ENWorld, _Q&A with Gary Gygax_ part 5, 2004

## Sources

__Note:__ Several of these quotes date back to a series of thirteen Q&A
threads on the ENWorld forum between 2002 and 2008. In 2015, these were
compiled into single massive thread, titled
[Q&A with Gary Gygax](http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?22566-Q-amp-A-with-Gary-Gygax).
Regrettably, many links to the original threads are now broken.

In 2011, _Blog of Holding_ collected all of Gary's Q&A replies
[into one page](http://blogofholding.com/?p=2761). Unfortunately, this was
since taken down and made into a book, _Cheers, Gary_, which at time of
writing appears to be out of print.

Gygax also answered many questions at the Dragonsfoot forums, collected there in
the [Zagyg's Wisdom](https://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=50)
board.
