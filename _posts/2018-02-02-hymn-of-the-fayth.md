The meaning of _Final Fantasy X_ song _Hymn of the Fayth_ is, at this point,
widely known. Less frequently observed, however, is this: The song makes most
sense if you assume it was __written vertically__ right-to-left, as old Japanese
was, but __read horizontally__ left-to-right, as modern Japanese is.

This makes sense if the hymn was written down almost a thousand years ago, lost,
and rediscovered centuries later. However, it may simply be an attempt to convey
the feeling of a forgotten language.

## Reconstructed original script

い | え   | ゆ | い | | i  | e  | yu | i
の | ぼ   | め | の | | no | bo | me | no
れ | ん   | み | り | | re | n  | mi | ri
よ | じゅ | よ | ご | | yo | ju | yo | go

は | さ | | ha | sa
て | か | | te | ka
な | え | | na | e
く | た | | ku | ta
   | ま | |    | ma
   | え | |    | e

## "Modern" lyrics

This is the song as it is sung throughout _Final Fantasy X_. It is acquired by
reading the above script from left-to-right.

いえゆい     | I e yu i          
のぼめの     | No bo me no       
れんみり     | Re n mi ri        
よじゅよご   | Yo ju yo go        
はさてかなえ | Ha sa te ka na e   
くたまえ     | Ku ta ma e        

This sounds like Japanese, since it uses Japanese syllables, but they don't form
actual Japanese words this way, so it's impossible to translate.

## "Ancient" lyrics

This is the "original" meaning of the song. It is acquired by reading the above
script from top-to-bottom, right-to-left.

Read in this direction, the text forms actual Japanese lyrics which match the
same tune.

Hiragana     | Romaji     | English translation
-------------|------------|---------------------------
いのりご     | Inorigo    | Fayth
ゆめみよ     | Yume mi yo | Dream!
えぼんじゅ   | Ebon-ju    | Yu Yevon
いのれよ     | Inore yo   | Pray!
さかえたまえ | Sakaetamae | Please grant prosperity
はてなく     | Hatenaku   | Without end

Some commentators assume the line pairs are read in the opposite order, but I
believe that is incorrect.

1. Japanese is written that sentences end with the verb. Therefore, the phrase
   "Inorigo yume miyo" (Fayth, dream) is a valid Japanese sentence.
2. When Japanese is written vertically, sentences are arranged right-to-left.
3. In order to match the meter of the melody, the last two lines must be
   "sakaetamae hatenaku", to match "hasatekanae kutamae".
