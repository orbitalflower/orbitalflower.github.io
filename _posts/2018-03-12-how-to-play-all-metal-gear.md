Playing through the entire _Metal Gear Solid_ series is absolutely worth it,
despite the dated graphics of the original. The biggest challenge is that the
games were released on different consoles and in different versions.

This article aims to help you plot a chart through the series, based on what
hardware you have or are willing to buy. This guide contains _no spoilers_.

## Main titles, all versions

The following table lists all platforms on which you can play each game in the
main _Metal Gear Solid_ series.

|                            | PSX | Win | GC | PS2 | Xbox | PSP | PS3 | 3DS | Vita | 360 | PS4 | XB1 |

Key:

* X: This game was released on this platform.
*  XB : This game can be played on this platform due to backward compatibility
  (PS2-PSX, Wii-Gamecube) or e-store (Wii virtual console, PSN).
* XX: The undisputably best version of this game is available on this platform
  (e.g. HD remake)
* X! : This game was only released on this platform.

### Individual games

* __Metal Gear Solid__'s original PSX release is available digitally for PSP and
  PS3, and the PS2 is backwardly compatible; in any case, it's worth buying
  either the Virtual Missions add-on, or a version of the game which includes
  Virtual Missions, although it's not necessary for the plot. The Gamecube
  edition, _Twin Snakes_, makes minor changes that fans debate. It's doubtful if
  the Windows version will still run on a modern PC; you may have more luck
  emulating the PSX version.
* __Metal Gear Solid 2__'s best version is the HD re-release on Playstation 3
  and Xbox 360. In both cases it's available in the _Metal Gear Solid HD
  Collection_ along with _MGS3_ and _Peace Walker_, at least in the US and
  European releases. There was an improved version of the original called
  _Substance_, but the HD remake supercedes this.
* __Metal Gear Solid 3__'s best version is likewise the HD re-release on PS3 and
  Xbox 360. These improve the camera controls. Widely considered one of the best
  of the series. There was an improved version called _Subsistence_, but the HD
  remake supercedes this.
* __Metal Gear Solid 4__ was released on Playstation 3 only, meaning that you'll
  need to buy or borrow a PS3 to play that one game. I recommend forcing 720p,
  since the game does support 1080p but runs poorly.
* __Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker__ was originally a PSP release, but its plot
  is vital to the later games; it introduces characters and concepts that will
  be vital in MGS5. The best version is the HD remake for PS3 and 360, although
  graphically and gameplay-wise it's still clearly a game of portable origins.
* __MGS5: Ground Zeroes__ follows on directly after _Peace Walker_. The PC
  version has the best graphics, assuming you have a good gaming PC, but the
  other versions are just fine. Completing it will give you some unlocks for
  MGSV.
* __MGSV: The Phantom Pain__ is one of the best games in the series. Again, the
  console versions are good, but a high end PC can have better graphics.

### Platform combinations

#### Top tier

At bare minimum, you will have to buy or borrow a PS3 to play MGS4, which was
only ever released on that platform. It does an important job of finishing off
the stories of all the characters from MGS1 and MGS2. However, it's the easiest
to skip, since it's chronologically the last in the series (apart from the
spinoff _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_).

Owning a PS3 will also allow you to play the virtual console version of the
original _Metal Gear Solid_, the HD remakes of 2, 3 and _Peace Walker_, and both
_Ground Zeroes_ and _Phantom Pain_, making it practical to play the entire
series on this system alone. The HD remake of MGS3 even comes with versions of
the original MSX _Metal Gear 1 & 2_.

Optimally, a high-end PC will give superior graphical performance on GZ and PP.
However, the PS3 can still run GZ and PP, making this single console the most
cost-effective.

#### High tier

Skipping MGS4, the Xbox 360 equally has the HD remakes of 2, 3 and _Peace
Walker_. It's recommended to play MGS1 first, for which you will need another
platform. A PSX emulator will suffice.

While you can play _Ground Zeroes_ and _Phantom Pain_ on a 360 or PS3, the newer
consoles (PS4/Xbone) will do so with better graphics, and a good PC will give
the best results.

#### Portable tier

If you don't have a PS3 or 360, or want to play on a portable device, the PS
Vita will let you play the digital version of MGS1, the HD remakes of 2 and 3,
and _Peace Walker_. These lack the high resolution of the console remakes, of
course, and you will need another platform to play MGS5.

There's a 3DS version of _Metal Gear Solid 3_, but whatever console you played
_Metal Gear Solid 2_ on is also capable of playing 3, unless you played 2 on
original Xbox.

Owning a PSP or Vita gives you the advantage that you can also play _Metal Gear
Solid: Portable Ops_, a game which fits between MGS3 and _Peace Walker_ but is
of dubious canonicity since Kojima didn't work on it.

#### Scrub tier

So you have no console newer than 2004. This isn't insurmountable, but you won't
be able to play the entire series this way.

Start with the original _Metal Gear Solid_, which was released on PSX, meaning
it will also run on a PS2 or can be emulated on even an older PC. The Gamecube
version tones down some of the characters' accents, which is consistent with
their later apperances in _Metal Gear Solid 4_ but that's not how most fans
remember it.

_Metal Gear Solid 2_ appears on PS2 and Xbox, and while you'll miss out on the
improved graphics of the HD remakes, the PS2 version includes that rare
skateboarding minigame. _Metal Gear Solid 3_ is on PS2 only, as far as you're
concerned, and you'll miss out on the HD remake's improved camera controls.

The drawback to playing MGS2 and 3 on older consoles is that if you intend to
acquire the ability play the newer Metal Gear games at some point, you'll
probably also acquire the ability to play the superior HD remakes. However, you
might do this if you have a high-end PC to play MGSV and just want to play MGS3
first.

### Play order

The optimal way to play the Metal Gear Solid series is __original release
order__: 1, 2, 3, 4, Peace Walker, Ground Zeroes, and Phantom Pain.

The reason is that while not all games are in chronological order (e.g. _Phantom
Pain_ will not spoil _MGS4_), newer games introduce improved game mechanics and
graphics, and going back may be frustrating.

An exception is that _Peace Walker_ and _MGS4_ can be played in any order, since
_Peace Walker_ is a PSP port and even in its HD remake has worse graphics and
different controls, but is set chronologically before _MGS4_ and doesn't spoil
it.

Plot-wise, the series chronologically goes in this order: 3, (Portable Ops),
Peace Walker, Ground Zeroes, Phantom Pain, (MG1), (MG2), 1, 2, 4, (Revengeance).
From the perspective of release order, there are two plot threads, one following
Solid Snake in the 21st Century (1, 2, 4) and one following Big Boss in the 20th
Century (3, PW, GZ, PP).

This gives you some leeway to skip 2 and 4 without spoiling chronologically
earlier games in the series. You may find yourself skipping _MGS4_ because you
don't own a PS3, or skipping _MGS2_ because the Fat Man boss fight is total
bullshit and none of that game's plot makes sense anyway.

I strongly recommend playing _Peace Walker_ to 100% completion before _Ground
Zeroes_ and _Phantom Pain_. It introduces important characters and provides
context.

_Portable Ops_ appears between 3 and Peace Walker, but its canonicity is
debatable, and many have skipped it due to the inconvenience of buying a PSP for
one game. Metal Gear 1 and 2, the MSX games, are canon, but are often skipped
for similar reasons, and also because they're very difficult and all their plot
is explained in _Metal Gear Solid_ anyway.

### Completeness

It's tempting to finish each game as quickly as possible and move on to the
next, but there are cases where this is less than optimal.

* _Peace Walker_ has a "true ending" that can only be unlocked by completing all
  of the side-missions. This is vital, since _Ground Zeroes_ follows on from
  this plot point almost immediately.
* Completing _Ground Zeroes_, and achieving certain results in that game, allows
  you to unlock various items in _The Phantom Pain_. However, none of the items
  are critical, you can go back to GZ and unlock them late, and most of your
  play skill with MGSV will still be useful in GZ when you do so. It's worth
  completing all the Ground Zeroes missions anyway.

In general, you want to complete a game before moving on to the next one, since
going back to an earlier game with inferior graphics and controls may be a
disappointing experience. You also want to get the maximum amount of Metal Gear,
so there's no point in skipping ahead.
