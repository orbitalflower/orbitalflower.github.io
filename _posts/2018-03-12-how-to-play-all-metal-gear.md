The _Metal Gear Solid_ series, vintage 1998-2015, is widely regarded as one of
the greatest video game series of all time. This guide gives advice for anyone
who'd like to play it, specifically the following:

- Which platforms each game is available on, and which versions are recommended
  for each game
- Which games are considered the main line series
- In which order the games should be played
- Common issues and how to avoid them

This guide contains no spoilers. It was revised substantially in November 2022.

**UPDATE (August 2023)**: This guide will be made redundant with the upcoming
release of the ''Metal Gear Solid Master Collection'', which will bring the main
MGS series to modern platforms:

- On 24 October 2023, the _Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1_ will be
  released for all major platforms: Windows, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series
  X/S. It contains _MGS1_, _MGS2_, and _MGS3_, which you should play in order,
  and the original 2D 8-bit _MG1_ and _MG2_, which you may optionally play.
- The upcoming _Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2_ is believed to
  include the rest of the main-line _Metal Gear Solid _series: _MGS4_,
  _Peace Walker_, _MGS5: Ground Zeroes_, and _MGSV: The Phantom Pain_,
  presumably for the same platforms.
- Additionally, a remake of _MGS3_, known as _Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake
  Eater_, is in development for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X/S.
- The game-specific advice below for first-time players and streamers will
  mostly remain relevant.

## The main series

The "main" or "canonical" _Metal Gear Solid_ series consists of seven games:

Metal Gear Solid (1998)
: Originally a PlayStation game, and can be emulated reliably. The
[PC version on GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/metal_gear_solid) is also
recommended: it is inexpensive, has been patched to run correctly on modern PCs,
and includes the VR Missions expansion.

Metal Gear Solid 2 (2001)
: Originally for PlayStation 2, but the best version is the HD Remake included
in the _HD Collection_ for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, which conveniently also
includes MGS3 and _Peace Walker_. All digital versions of MGS2 and the _HD
Collection_ have been unavailable since November 2021 due to issues with stock
footage licensing, but pre-owned copies are inexpensive.

Metal Gear Solid 3 (2004)
: Again, a PS2 game best played in the _HD Collection_ for PS3/360. Infamously
difficult to emulate on a PC, so real hardware is recommended. It's also the
only Metal Gear game released on Nintendo 3DS, but the e-shop for that platform
is shutting down in March 2023.

Metal Gear Solid 4 (2008)
: A PlayStation 3 exclusive. Because of this, the PS3 is the minimum hardware
necessary to play the entire MGS main series. _The Legacy Collection_ for PS3
contains MGS4 and the _HD Collection_, and a download code for MGS1 (though if
you buy a pre-owned copy, they probably redeemed the MGS1 code already).

Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker (2010)
: Originally for PSP, but the best version is in the _HD Collection_ for
PS3/360. Despite the lack of number, this is a key part of the series.

Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes (2014)
: The PC version has the best graphics, especially if you have a very good PC.
A pack called
[The Definitive Experience](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/132479/) on Steam
contains both _Ground Zeroes_ and _The Phantom Pain_ plus some cosmetic DLC, and
is currently retailing for $7.49 during a Steam sale. If you don't own a good
PC, the PlayStation 3 version is surprisingly playable.

Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain (2015)
: Same as _Ground Zeroes_. The PC release has the advantage of a modding
community.

## Playing the main series

It is generally recommended to play the games in release order, beginning with
_Metal Gear Solid_. You have a lot of options, so use whatever platform is
convenient.

The MGS [PC version on GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/metal_gear_solid) is
good, cheap, and convenient, but missing a few famous easter eggs in the Psycho
Mantis battle. Pre-owned copies of the PlayStation version cost about as much as
the original retail price, but you can play them natively on any PSX, PS2, or
PS3, or emulate on a PC. A digital copy is available in the PSP/PS3 e-shop.
There's even the GameCube version, _Twin Snakes_, but copies are expensive
nowadays, and makes some controversial changes (some iconic lines change and
characters lose their accents the re-dub, though that would be correct going
forward).

For the next four games, it's strongly recommended to acquire a PlayStation 3,
since you'll need one anyway for MGS4. Pre-owned copies of the _HD Collection_
and MGS4 are inexpensive. If you intend on streaming from a PS3 you will need a
compatible HDMI adaptor that doesn't suffer from HDCP issues.

For the last two, _Ground Zeroes_ and _The Phantom Pain_, the PS3 will play them
surprisingly well if you're on a budget, but a high-end PC is much better. The
middle-ground is PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, if you have either of those.

## Advice for players

### Metal Gear Solid

- Like most games of its era, MGS1 does not feature autosave. The PC version
  lets you quicksave, but traditional and recommended save method is to call Mei
  Ling on the codec, whereupon she may give you useful advice. Be sure that you
  actually save; it's not necessarily clear whether the white or green text is
  highlighting the the correct one. If you save on the PSX version, you will be
  given a save slot to pick from.
- You should watch the BRIEFING before starting the game. There are multiple
  sections to the briefing.
- In general, you should engage to as many codec calls as possible, since an
  enormous amount of the game's content is optional codec conversations.
- Natasha Romanenko's frequency is 141.52. She won't call you first, since she's
  entirely optional, so you have to call her manually. She mainly gives
  background information on the characters.
- At some point in the game you will be referred to the back of the CD case to
  find Meryl's codec frequency; since you probably playing a digital version,
  that frequency is 140.15.
- To perform a choke on an enemy, you need to approach from behind and press the
  button (square) without holding a direction. If you hold a direction, you'll
  throw them instead. To kill the enemy, you need to mash the button, not just
  hold it. Very importantly, don't stand too close to the enemy before
  performing the grab, or you will make contact with the enemy before the grab
  and set off an alert.

### Metal Gear Solid 2

- The intro screen of each game in the _HD Collection_ has spoilers for the
  events of the beginning of the game. Don't read it!
- From MGS2 onward, there is usually some reward for beating the game without
  any lethal kills. However, it's not necessary.
- From MGS2 onward, bosses have two health bars: a health bar depleted by lethal
  weapons, and a stamina bar depleted by non-lethal weapons. It's therefore
  advantageous to only use one or the other against each boss.
- MGS2 has a surprisingly plot-relevant easter egg that's easy to miss. When you
  are using the directional microphone to listen in on a conversation, turn it
  left instead and listen to the guard in the bathroom. Later, at the oil fence
  bridge, when the person you're escorting walks behind a pillar, point the
  directional microphone at the pillar to listen in on another conversation by
  the same guy.

### Metal Gear Solid 3

- You will be asked at the beginning which MGS game you like the most. Do not
  fret too much over this decision, as it does not affect much. The traditional
  response is "I like MGS2!", assuming you played MGS2. The powergamer's choice
  is MGS3, which unlocks some bonus camo sets.
- The separate health bar applies here: bosses have a health bar, depleted by
  lethal weapons, and a stamina bar, depleted by non-lethal weapons. There's no
  point in using both types.
- MGS3 is a good game to play through twice, picking up the missing achievements
  on the second playthrough.

### Metal Gear Solid 4

- MGS4 was released before Peace Walker. This is important if you want to play
  in release order. However, since Peace Walker is set in the 1970s after MGS3,
  one does not directly spoil the other, so it is not a major problem to play
  these two out of order.
- It is mandatory to install the game to hard disk before play, even if you're
  playing from a disk. This is time consuming if you intend to play on stream.
  The process may take fifteen minutes before you can play.
- I recommend forcing the PS3 to 720p to improve framerate. The game was
  originally developed to only run at 720p.
- You may also want to enable subtitles in-game, since they're not on by
  default.
- You should watch the Mission Briefing for Act 1 from the main menu. It's not
  shown in normal play to allow you to get into the game more quickly.
- During play, you can mash X when the symbol appears at the top right of the
  screen.

### Peace Walker

- You should complete all the side missions to unlock the true final boss battle
  mission. It features important plot events that will be relevant in subsequent
  games. If you can't manage it, there are audio tapes in _Ground Zeroes_ which
  recap the situation.

### Ground Zeroes and Phantom Pain

- _Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes_ is a short game which primarily exists to
  bridge the narrative gap between _Peace Walker_ and _The Phantom Pain_.
- Some missions in _Ground Zeroes_ unlock item blueprints or staff members in
  _The Phantom Pain_. I recommend doing at least the main mission and the
  helicopter shooter shooter side-mission.
- In _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_, there's a character appearance
  customization at the beginning, but after you select it, you appear as the
  default appearance, which confuses some players. What you're actually
  selecting is your avatar for the online mode.

## Advice for streamers

Not all HDMI capture devices will let you stream correctly from a PlayStation 3.
Ensure that you purchase one which can.

The _Metal Gear Solid_ series is hugely popular, and many of your viewers will
have either played it or seen another streamer play it recently. The risk of
spoilers in the chat is extremely high. Remind viewers that you have not played
this game before and do not want spoilers. Don't ask the chat plot questions if
you don't want to receive spoilers. It's useful to establish an anti-spoiler
protocol, such as asking viewers to spam a smile emote in chat if someone posts
spoilers or you ask a question to which the answer is a spoiler; this will
signal you to avoid chat for a while.

It's been so long since the game came out that many people will mis-remember
details or confuse one game for another. Streamers are at particular risk of
being One Guyed. For example, In the helicopter fight in MGS1, there is no
ration under the central block; that's only in _Twin Snakes_. Rations don't
restore health in MGS3; you need Life Med for that.

Don't feel bad about playing on easier difficulty in order to make it through
the game. Streaming divides your attention, and you can always replay a game on
harder difficulty once you've mastered the game.

_Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_ uses a huge amount of licensed music
which may trigger DMCA. There's no option to disable music, and as far as I
know, nobody has yet created a mod to disable or replace the music. Have a
button set up to mute the game audio and be ready to use it. It particularly
plays in cassette tapes at various bases, which stop when you collect the tape,
and at the jail cell on the medical platform.

## Notable other Metal Gear games

Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2
: The original 8-bit MSX games, which are included with MGS3 in the _HD
Collection_ (and the PS2 improved release _Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence_).
They're difficult, although they're considered canon. Some purists may attempt
to play the MGS series starting with the MSX games, but there's a risk that
you'll give up before you finish it. The events of these games are summarized in
a codec call in MGS1.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance
: A popular and highly recommended game set after MGS4. It's an action game
rather than a stealth game, where you play a sword-wielding cyborg. Available
cheaply on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and for PC in a Steam sale near you.

Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops
: A PSP/PS Vita release which fills in the gap between MGS3 and Peace Walker.
It's generally considered non-canon, and was never available on a non-portable
platform. It received an updated version called Portable Ops Plus. I haven't
played either of these.

Metal Gear: Ghost Babel
: GameBoy Color release.

Metal Gear Acid and Metal Gear Acid 2
: PSP releases.

Metal Gear Survive
: The worst rated Metal Gear game ever. Watch
