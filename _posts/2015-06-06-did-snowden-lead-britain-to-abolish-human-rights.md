Hypothesis: Britain's plans to abolish Human Rights legislation and withdraw
from the EU are a direct reaction to Edward Snowden's leaks revealing the UK's
massive illegal surveillance network.
{:.lead}

Yesterday, media outlets celebrated the second anniversary of the first
published Snowden disclosures on 5 June 2013. Fearing disclosure of Britain's
own classified programmes, Prime Minister David Cameron had the Guardian's copy
of the Snowden files destroyed on 20 July 2013. The BBC was issued with a notice
not to report on the leaks, and Cameron threatened to issue the Guardian with a
similar notice in October 2013.

While Cameron had intentions to abolish the Human Rights Act since at least
2005, it wasn't until 3 October 2014 that the Guardian published Chris Grayling
MP's drastic plans to [abandon the European Convention on Human
Rights](https://orbitalflower.github.io/20150531-decoding-tory-doublespeak.html).
Even the Tory party is split on this plan.

Grayling was certainly aware of GCHQ's operations. The highest level of [RIPA
powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPA#Powers) covering interception of a
communication can only be authorised by a warrant from the Home Secretary or
Justice Secretary, who at time were Theresa May and Chris Grayling,
respectively. [The Guardian
reports](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/05/what-to-look-out-for-britain-new-surveillance-bill)
that the extent of such warrants are significant:

> According to the ISCâ€™s February 2015 report, there are currently 19 warrants
> in place that cumulatively authorise the interception of billions of
> communications each day.

If May and Grayling were not aware of the precise details of GCHQ's programmes,
they were certainly made aware post-Snowden, along with the GCHQ's fears that
the bulk collection systems authorised by May and Grayling, it made public,
would almost certainly be ruled illegal on privacy grounds under the European
Convention for Human Rights.

It is highly likely, therefore, that by October 2014 when Grayling published
"Protecting human rights in the UK", he was aware that:

* The EU courts would rule that programmes he signed off on were illegal
* The Tories' plans to abolish the Human Rights Act would not save GCHQ
programmes from EU court rulings
* Only three things could save GCHQ at this point: Making European court rulings
non-binding on Britain, withdrawing from the ECHR, or leaving the EU. In his
document, __Grayling recommends all three of these.__

Consequently, the Tory party manifesto for 2015 made unexpected new pledges:

* To re-negotiate an opt-out from the European Court of Human Rights
* To hold a referendum for Britain leave the EU

The Tories had long suggested abolishing the Human Rights Act, which would
prevent citizens from suing for human rights in UK courts, but would have still
allowed European courts to impose legally binding rulings on the UK.

__Without the Snowden disclosures, GCHQ's surveillance systems would still be
classified and could operate without fear of the European courts ruling them
illegal.__ Snowden placed GCHQ in direct threat that could only be stopped if
the Conservatives came to power with a plan to quickly withdraw Britain from the
European Court of Human Rights, and that's exactly what happened.

However, there's the small question of whether or not Grayling would have tried
to get rid of the EU courts anyway.

Pre-Snowden, on 22 November 2012, Grayling was tasked with implementing an EU
ruling of five years previous that at least some prisoners have the right to
vote. When MPs voted against it, Grayling suggested [a draft
bill](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20431995) that would effectively
delay the problem until the next election, and suggested that it wasn't
necessarily illegal to ignore ECHR rulings, that the UK could do so if it
accepted the political fallout. This suggests he may have already been quite
open to disobeying the EU.

Tomorrow, back to whining about web standards.
