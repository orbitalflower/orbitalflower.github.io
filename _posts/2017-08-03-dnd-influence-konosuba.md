title: "D&D's influence on KONOSUBA"
categories: tv anime
---

In this article, I propose that anime and light novel series KONOSUBA (_Kono
Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!_; God's Blessing on This Wonderful World) was
inspired directly by Dungeons & Dragons, in particular late AD&D 2nd edition
circa 1996.

## Context

It is known that several Dungeons & Dragons books were translated into Japanese,
including AD&D 2nd edition and D&D 3rd edition. Most Japanese RPG stories are
inspired _indirectly_ by D&D via other video games and anime, notably _Final
Fantasy_ (1987). However, Konosuba draws heavily from aspects of D&D that rarely
appear in Japanese video RPGs.

Konosuba would not be the first Japanese novel based on a tabletop RPG. _Record
of Lodoss War_ (1988) was based specifically on a Dungeons & Dragons game
record.

## Characters

### Megumin

#### Explosion!

AD&D 2nd edition expansion _Player's Option: Spells & Magic_ actually made it
possible to construct a custom wizard class that only knows one specific type of
magic, has trouble learning new spells, can only cast one extremely powerful
spell per day, has to chant dramatically to cast it, and collapses at the
end.

The cover of that same book features a wizard attacking a castle with a massive
fireball.

#### Crimson Demon

Megumin is a _koumazoku_, or crimson demon, a race resembling humans except for
red eyes and a talent for magic. This closely describes a D&D race known as the
[tiefling](/rpg/races/tiefling.html), at least as it appears from its creation
in AD&D 2nd edition until D&D 3rd edition (1994-2008). Tieflings looked
radically different from 4th edition onward.

_Koumazoku_ would be a good localisation for "tiefling". Both the prefix "ko"
and suffix "-ling" are diminutives referring to children (e.g. _koneko_, meaning
kitten, and "duckling"). "Mazoku" meaning "demon" matches the tiefling's origin
as descended from demons, while "tief", German for "deep", refers to their
origins in the "lower planes" during the 90s when "demon" and "hell" were
forbidden in D&D publications.

#### Chomusuke

Wizards in D&D can have a familiar. A third edition ability called Improved
Familiar allows a wizard to acquire a Fiendish familiar, such as a part-demon
black cat instead of a regular one.

#### Tiny dragon

In season 2, Megumin meets a tiny dragon. These exist in D&D, known as
pseudodragons. A third edition feat called Improved Familiar allows a wizard to
acquire a pseudodragon as a familiar.

#### Archwizard

See the appendix to this article for rules on a hypothetical archwizard advanced
class.

### Aqua

#### Level 21

Dungeons & Dragons typically caps out at level 20. Levels 21 and up are reserved
for exceptional characters, such as deities. Deities often have exceptionally
high ability scores.

#### Turn Undead

Clerics in D&D have the specific ability Turn Undead, which forces undead to
flee and destroys weak undead. This ability originates in D&D is rarely copied
by video games, which generally take the more logical approach of making
anti-undead magic one of the cleric's spells.

#### Purification

The first-level cleric spell _purify food and drink_ cleans impure water. It has
a maximum effect of one cubic foot per level (for Aqua, that's 21 cubic feet),
meaning that to purify an entire lake she would have to cast the spell
repeatedly.

In the series, Aqua can purify water at will simply by touch and even does it by
accident. This is a reasonable power for a goddess of water.

#### Sacred Break Spell

Removing a curse is trivial for a high-level priest. In AD&D 2nd edition it's
done with the third-level spell _remove curse_, while in 3rd edition curses can
be removed with the 5th-level _break enchantment_.

#### Blessing

Aqua's minor buff spell "Blessing" assists party members in combat. This is
similar to D&D's _bless_, a cleric spell with that effect.

#### Nature's Beauty

The AD&D 2nd edition expansion _Player's Option: Spells & Magic_ introduced
_orison_, a very low-level cleric spell that performs minor effects similar to
the 2e wizard spell _cantrip_ or the 3e wizard spell _prestidigitation_.

#### Mending

In season 2, Aqua repairs a torn piece of paper. This is the capability of
_mending_, a low-level D&D spell. In D&D 3rd edition it's available to clerics
as well as wizards; in AD&D 2nd edition it's a wizard-exclusive power. In either
case it can repair a paper torn in two, but not paper turn into shreds.

#### Create Water

A first-level cleric spell, _create water_. The AD&D 2nd expansion _Player's
Option: Spells & Magic_, there exists a spell _tsunami_, available to clerics of
water, which summons a massive wave of water capable of destroying even stone
city fortifications.

#### Resurrection

A standard cleric capability in D&D. The cleric spells _raise dead_ (5th level)
and _resurrection_ (7th level) bring a character back to life.

It is stated that Aqua can return a body to life even if it is a skeleton (true
of _resurrection_, but not _raise dead_), but not if the body is completely
destroyed (possible under D&D third edition's _true resurrection_).

#### Consecrated ground

Aqua turns undead in the graveyard and then places a barrier preventing or
discouraging the banished spirits from returning there. A few D&D spells match
this: _consecrate_ (D&D 3e), _hallow_ (D&D 3e), and _sanctify_ (AD&D 2e's _Tome
of Magic_).

#### Warding circle

When Aqua allows the lich to pass on, she draws a magic circle which it later
turns out is causing creatures to leave the dungeon. This resembles
_antipathy/sympathy_, a high level AD&D spell which creates a zone from which
creatures will flee. That said, _antipathy/sympathy_ is a wizard spell.

#### Demon trap

Aqua traps a succubus in a circle when it comes to visit Kazuma. This is a
capability of _protection from evil_, a cleric spell which draws a circle
impassable by demons to keep them out (or, alternatively, keep them in). It
blocks mental control by demons also. Generally, one needs to create such a
circle before summoning a demon.

#### Detect Undead

Aqua demonstrates the ability to sense undead. Although _detect undead_ is a
wizard-only spell in AD&D 2nd edition, a variant ability in _Player's Option:
Spells & Magic_ allows priests to use it.

### Darkness

#### Crusader

The crusader class appears by that name in the AD&D 2nd edition expansion
_Player's Option: Spells & Magic_. It is essentially a variant kind of paladin
which lacks the ability to Turn Undead.

#### Follower of Eris

Crusaders, like paladins in D&D, are generally followers of a deity. They're
specifically described as soldier-priests.

#### Stamina

In the season 2 opening, the party runs for less than a mile and become
exhausted - all except Darkness. This makes sense in D&D where the same stat,
Constitution, is used for both hit points and running stamina. Darkness appears
to have extremely high hit points, which is difficult to achieve in AD&D, and
explains why she keeps throwing herself in front of attacks.

#### Adamantine armour

Adamantine is an exceptionally hard metal used to craft weapons and armour in
D&D. Darkness states that her armour is made from this metal.

#### Lalatina

The name Darkness happens to be a spell in D&D, which tieflings are able to cast
(see Megumin).

"Lalatina" resembles the Japanese _puratina_, meaning "platinum", and with
similarity to "paladin".

### Crapuma

#### Steeeeeeal!

Pick Pockets is a thief-exclusive skill in AD&D. It's not a magical move in
AD&D, but the basis is there.

Although Kazuma is officially of the Adventurer class, or _boukensha_, his use
of Steal and other skills marks him as a kind of Thief. This complements the
others in a traditional party of four: warrior, priest, mage and thief.

#### Sneak

Hide in Shadows and Move Silently are thief-exclusive skills in AD&D.

#### Armour

Kazuma buys a suit of full plate, but literally can't move in it. Thieves in
AD&D aren't proficient in heavy armour, and literally can't wear it. Rogues in
3rd edition can technically wear it, but only with massive penalties.

#### Katana

Kazuma has a katana made, but is far too clumsy with it and has it cut down to a
shorter sword. This makes sense if he's a thief-type character, who in AD&D is
proficient with short swords but not long swords.

### Wiz

#### Drain Touch

Wiz's ability Drain Touch absorbs life from a target, and is described as a lich
skill. Liches in D&D don't have an innate drain touch (they do have paralyze
touch), but as powerful wizards they do have _vampiric touch_, a third level
necromancy spell which absorbs hit points.

A general trope in D&D is that necromancy magic is shunned, which explains why
Drain Touch is considered a lich skill, and why Kazuma is shunned for using it.

#### Teleport

In the fight with Mobile Fortress Destroyer, Wiz teleports away an exploding
orb. This matches the effect of the AD&D 2nd edition spell _vanish_, which
teleports away an object. However, teleporting in AD&D has poor accuracy and a
high risk of error. The spell _vanish_ doesn't appear in D&D 3rd edition.

#### Lich

D&D invented the lich, a high-level wizard who becomes undead. It has since
spread to countless other games, of course.

## World elements

### Creatures

#### Powerful slimes

At the end of season 2, Kazuma believes slimes are a weak enemy, a trope from
the _Dragon Quest_ series. Darkness corrects him: in this world, slimes are
frequently lethal. This is the status quo in Dungeons & Dragons.

#### Giant frogs

Giant frogs with their ability to swallow humans appear as far back as the AD&D
1st edition _Monster Manual_. This ability was infamous enough to appear in a
sketch of the giant frog in the D&D 5th edition _Monster Manual_ (2014), which,
although published after the Konosuba light novel, appeared before the Konosuba
anime (2016).

#### Wall mimic

In one dungeon, Kazuma detects a mimic in the direction of a treasure chest. It
revealed that the chest is normal, and the wall behind it is the mimic.

In nearly every game where mimics appear, they are disguised exclusively as
treasure chests. However, in D&D they're shapechangers capable of assuming the
form of anything stone or wood. In early D&D sources, before the treasure chest
form was established, mimics were described as mimicking dungeon walls.

### Other

#### Bell of truth

The D&D spell _zone of truth_ prevents someone from lying. A magic item can
easily be created to replicate the effect.

#### Character sheets

D&D characters typically act as if they're aware of the measurement of their own
stats, which are recorded by the player on a sheet of paper.

#### Advanced classes

D&D is not the only game to feature advanced versions of existing classes, but
the concept as it is used in Konosuba closely matches the version which appears
in AD&D 2nd edition.

Classes in AD&D have ability score prerequisites: you must have a certain
Strength, Intelligence or whatever to take this class. More powerful classes
have multiple high prerequisites so that they remain rare. You do not need a
certain level or skill to qualify for such a class, only to be born with the
correct numbers, so it's possible to be a member of such a rare class and still
be completely incompetent.

D&D 3rd edition completely changed this system. Prestige classes no longer use
ability score prerequisites, but generally require something like seven levels
in another standard class. D&D 4th edition prestige paths require ten standard
levels. Both would rule out Megumin (canonically level 6 archwizard).

## Counter-evidence

A few details are inconsistent with Konosuba as a D&D game.

### Level 30 NPC

An NPC describes himself as a newbie of "only level 30", In a videogame RPG,
level 30 is low level; in D&D, it's epic, deity-level power.

### Luck stat

Luck isn't a standard ability score in D&D.

### Devil King

The Devil King, or Maou, is an especially Japanese RPG trope. D&D's demons and
devils live in an alternate realm, and generally only enter the human world when
summoned by a spellcaster. They don't rule kingdoms in the world of men.

However, there is at least once exception: the World of Greyhawk D&D setting has
a demon king called _Iuz the Old_.

## Appendix: Advanced classes

### Archwizard

Assume you have access to _Player's Option: Spells & Magic_. Your goal is to
construct a character class so broken that it can defeat any enemy in one hit.
It doesn't matter if you can only do it one day, collapse at the end, because
you can just rest and do it again the next day.

You spend your 40 points as follows:

- Only have access to Invocation magic (5 pts)
- Enhanced casting level: Cast any spell as if you were 1-4 levels higher... but
  only once per day (10 pts)
- Improved hit die: d8 (+20 pts)
- Learning bonus: +25% to learn new Invocation spells (7 pts)
- No components for Invocation only: because carrying a bunch of sulphur around
  is for scrub wizards (5 pts)
- Range increase for Invocation only, +50%. (7 pts)
- Research bonus: New Invocation spells count as one level lower (5 pts)
- School knowledge: Enemies have -2 to saves versus your Invocation spells (8
  pts)

Oops, we spent 67 points! Lets offset it with 27 points of penalties that don't
matter:

- Awkward casting method: The archwizard must shout the spell's vocal component
  at the top of her lungs (-5 pts)
- Behavior/taboo: Must always wear red (-2 pts)
- <strike>Learning penalty: -25% to learn non-Invocation spells (-8
  pts)</strike> DM rejected this because I already can't learn non-Invocation
  spells at all
- Reduced spell knowledge: Can learn half as many spells (-7 pts)
- Slow casting time: +1 full round (-5 pts)
- Talisman: Must have a staff to cast spells (-8 pts)

Now, when we reach level 3 we research a new spell, _explosion_, which is
exactly like _fireball_ except awesomer. We're researching a new spell instead
of just learning _fireball_ because it's one level too high for us to learn, but
we get a one-level research bonus on NEW spells.

We're still one level too low to actually cast _explosion_, but if we use the
spell points system we can get around that by spending double the normal amount
of MP. We'll only be able to cast it once per day, but that's fine, because we
only get our 1-4 level bonus once per day too.

Now boost the level even further with the following:

1. Make _explosion_ our Signature Spell, adding +2 caster levels to the damage
   and range
2. Spend an additional 200% MP to add +4 caster levels
3. Accept a prolonged casting time for a discount of 25% MP
4. Make our character a tiefling for the extra +1 Int to squeeze out another
   bonus point of MP

Now at level 3 we can cast _fireball_... I mean _explosion_ as a 10th-13th level
wizard... once, and it'll take ten minutes but it'll kill everything. At level 4
we're casting as an 11th-14th level wizard but it'll only take less than a
minute of loud chanting.

Lastly, use the Spell Fatigue rules to recover MP faster to do this again. The
drawback is that every casting of _explosion_ immediately renders the archwizard
unable to stand.

### Archpriest

Since the wizard's player is min/maxing their class, the priest may as well make
theirs. Starting with 120 points:

- Cleric spellcasting (100pts)
- Major Water spellcasting (3 pts)
- Detect undead (10 pts)
- Purify water (5 pts)
- Turn Undead (15 pts)
- Unarmed combat skills (15 pts)

Then to balance:

- Can't wield weapons except staff (-5 pts)
- Can't wear armour (-15 pts)
- Can't cast Earth spells (-3 pts)
- Fanaticism: Followers of your faith are insane (-5 pts)

You now have a regular priest, but awesomer. Also, it's the DM's character so
it's a level 21 deity.
