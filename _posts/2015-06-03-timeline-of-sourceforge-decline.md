Following the SourceForge adware controversy (see [How SourceForge started
spreading adware](https://orbitalflower.github.io/20150529-how-sourceforge-started-spreading-adware.html)),
I think it's particularly interesting to plot the site's gradual decline.

## Timeline

* __Nov 1999__: SourceForge founded.
* __Oct 2004__: GIMP for Windows moves to SourceForge.
* __30 Sep 2006__: SourceForge revenue reported $6.49 million.

* __30 Apr 2007__: SourceForge revenue reported $10.3 million.

* __8 Feb 2008__: GitHub founded.
* __2009__: SourceForge reports gross quarterly income of US$23m.
* __2010__: VLC media player moves its download hosting to SourceForge.
* __7 Jul 2011__: VideoLAN complains of other sites distributing versions of VLC
media player [with
adware/malware](https://blog.l0cal.com/2011/07/07/these-companies-that-mislead-our-users/).
* __3 Nov 2011__: SourceForge Open Source Mirror System creates dummy project
pages to host downloads of open source projects that don't use SourceForge.
Promises to never use adware, install wrappers or other malware, a promise it
would eventually break. Creates accounts sf-editor1, sf-editor2 and sf-editor3
to manage the dummy project pages.
* __2 Dec 2011__: SourceForge claims 324,000 projects, 46 million consumers and
more than 4m downloads per day.
* __2011__: SourceForge, Slashdot and Freecode reportedly generate $20m annual
revenue.

* __5 Jan 2012__: SourceForge claims more than 40 million users per month.
* __2012__: SourceForge increases the amount of third-party advertising on the
site. VideoLAN repeatedly complains that their download page shows ads
[masquerading as the VLC download
button](https://blog.l0cal.com/2013/05/02/rethinking-vlc-mirrors-infrastructure/),
which lead to sites offering malware-infected copies of VLC. Failing to block
these ads, SourceForge begins paying VideoLAN a share of the ad revenue
amounting to thousands of dollars per month.
* __18 Sep 2012__: Dice Holdings buys SourceForge along with FreeCode and
Slashdot for US$20m. SourceForge reportedly has 40m unique visitors each month.
(Source: [GeekNet](http://investors.geek.net/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=707379))
* __11 Apr 2013__: SourceForge is serving as many as 6.7 million downloads of
VLC per week, around 10% of SourceForge total downloads and its most popular
project at the time. It continues to fail to remove misleading advertising. In
response, VideoLAN is has begun moving off SourceForge to their own hosting
service.
* __23 April 2013__: VLC's new hosting is targeted by a [DDOS
attack](http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/security-visualization-vlan-ddos-visualized-as-a-game-of-pong/).
* __2 May 2013__: SourceForge still promises not to include adware or malware.
* __1 Jul 2013__: SourceForge [launches
DevShare](https://sourceforge.net/blog/today-we-offer-devshare-beta-a-sustainable-way-to-fund-open-source-software/),
a project to insert adware into downloads. It promises to be strictly opt-in and
to share revenue with project developers. Some projects, such as FileZilla, have
already opted in.
* __12 Sep 2013__: SourceForge Open Source Mirror Directory has amended its
no-adware promise by this date. It no longer considers adware to be malware, and
no longer promises not to modify downloads.
* __5 Nov 2013__: GIMP declines SourceForge's offer to join DevShare and
officially stops hosting Windows downloads at SourceForge due to misleading ads.
* __14 Nov 2013__: SourceForge announces its [BlockThis
initiative](http://sourceforge.net/blog/advertising-bundling-community-and-criticism/)
to handle misleading advertising. Only 3 projects have opted into DevShare.
SourceForge promises never to include alware without the consent of the project
developer, a promise it would later break.
* __23 Dec 2013__: GitHub passes 10 million repositories.
* __10 Feb 2014__: By this date, SourceForge has deleted the section promising
promising not to provide malware in its downloads. Now claims over 42 million
visitors.
* __1 Jan 2015__: SourceForge boasts 430,000 projects, 41.8m customers and 4.8m
downloads per day.
* __12 Mar 2015__: Google announces plans to [shut down Google
Code](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html),
disables creation of new projects.
* __21 Mar 2015__: SourceForge has not yet taken over abandoned projects by this
date.
* __22 Apr 2015__: By this date, SourceForge Open Mirror Directory has expanded
to take over popular former SourceForge projects which left the site, such as
VLC and GIMP for Windows. Some projects have malware embedded despite earlier
assurances that the adware system would be purely opt-in.
* __16 May 2015__: GIMP developer asks SourceForge to remove gimp-win from the
site. They don't. SourceForge later claims they didn't receive this message.
* __28 May 2015__: After much negative publicity, SourceForge announces it has
stopped embedding adware in GIMP for Windows.
* __1 June 2015__: SourceForge announces it has [stopped including
adware](https://sourceforge.net/blog/third-party-offers-will-be-presented-with-opt-in-projects-only/)
in its mirrors of abandoned projects.
