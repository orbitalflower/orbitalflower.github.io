title: "Apotheosis prestige classes"

In retrospect, one of the weirdest standard D&D third edition rules was the
transformational or apotheosis type of prestige class, an advanced character
class that turned the character into some radically different creature. These
began in the excellent [Tome and Blood][] (2001)
and only got weirder from there.

Due to a phenomenon I like to call _completionism_[^1], T&B's invention of the
apotheosis prestige class inspired several similar prestige classes whose
goal seems to be turning you into different monster types. Generally speaking,
the character acquires their new type as the capstone ability at the end of a
ten-level prestige class.

## Monster types

### Aberration

- Aberrant paragon class (Dragon #332) gains the aberration type at level 3, its
  final level.
- Fleshwarper (Lords of Madness) gains the aberration type.

The Alienist is aberration-like, but only gains the Outsider type.

D&D lore suggests that mind flayers were originally humans who transformed, and
that's something you can do by applying the mind flayer level progression in
Savage Species, which is balanced level for level. The drawback is that it's a
fifteen level class for only 8d8 hit dice. Hence, something like the Fleshwarper
makes more sense.

### Animal

Animal isn't a popular target for transformation, aside from classes like druid
who can transform temporarily into animals. Animals can't hold weapons well, and
the type itself is essentially low-intelligence; animals who gain high
intelligence generally become magical beasts. A prestige class to turn into
animal type is therefore very unlikely.

### Beast

This type was removed in D&D 3.5.

### Construct

- Green Star Adept (Complete Arcane) gains the construct type. It involves
  eating rare ore from comets to become living emerald.

I'd be surprised if there wasn't a mechanical prestige class to become a robot
or golem-like creature by mechanical enhancement. These already exist in magic
items (Arm of Nyr) and monsters (half-golem).

### Deathless

- Risen Martyr (Book of Exalted Deeds) becomes deathless upon reaching level 1.

Deathless is a rare "undead, except good instead of evil" type that appears in
Book of Exalted Deeds. That book is the prime example of completionist design,
creating good-aligned mirror versions of content from Book of Vile Darkness even
when it made no sense (good disease, good poison, etc).

### Dragon

- Dragon Disciple ([Tome and Blood][]) gains the half-dragon template, becoming
  dragon type.

Dragon Disciple was popular, but it took up ten levels, whereas the half-dragon
template took three.

### Elemental

- Elementalist ([Tome and Blood][]) gains the elemental type.
- Winterhaunt (Frostburn) gains the elemental type at level 10.

Elementalist is a general prestige class for spellcasters to become fire, water,
air or earth elementals; winterhaunt is for cold. There's still room for
new classes of specific elemental types or relating to specific elemental
creatures. Winterhaunt further opens the completionism/expansionism to
good-aligned specialist elemental classes.

In addition to the four core elements (air, earth, fire and water), there are
the old-school para-elemental planes where those planes overlap (ice, magma,
ooze and smoke). However, of those, smoke is incorporeal and hard to balance,
and ooze is already somewhat covered in the oozemaster prestige class.

### Fey

- Rimefire Witch (Frostburn) gains the fey type at 10th level.
- Spirit Shaman (Complete Divine), a standard class rather than a prestige
  class, gains the fey type at level 20.
- Swanmay (Book of Exalted Deeds) gains the fey type at 10th level.
- Tree-Friend (Dragon #307) gains the fey type at level 5 of 5.
- Wildrunner (Races of the Wild) gains the fey type at level 9 of 10.

### Giant

- Thrall of Kostchtchie (Dragon #345) gains giant type at level 10, if they were
  originally humanoid or monstrous humanoid.

Giant is generally unsuitable for player character transformations. It's just a
really tall humanoid. You would gain reach and not fit into dungeons any more.
The mundane nature of giants makes it difficult to provide magical justification
for a transformation.

Savage Species has a six-level ogre progression that could be used to simulate
an existing character somehow growing huge. It gets four of six levels in hit
dice, equivalent to poor base attack but more than compensated for by Strength
and Constitution bonuses, natural armor and large size with reach.

### Humanoid

Most player characters are already humanoid. You could transform into a
different humanoid, but it's not a type-changing class, which is the point of
this list.

### Magical beast

- Primeval (Frostburn) gains the magical beast type at level 10. It's a prestige
  class for characters who revert to a more primitive form.

It's difficult to make another prestige class that turns a human into a beast.

### Monstrous humanoid

<!--
I'm not aware of any prestige class that transforms someone into a monstrous
humanoid. This is surprising because it's an entirely plausible transformation;
monstrous humanoids are still bipedal and able to wear equipment and wield
weapons.

The feral template (Savage Species) will grant a the monstrous humanoid type to
a base humanoid, but that's a template, not a prestige class.

The most plausible is something like a minotaur transformation class that would
probably look a lot like Dragon Disciple, gaining ability score improvements and
natural weapons over levels. There are also some level progressions in Savage
Species that cover the harpy, medusa and various hags.
-->

- Deep Thrall (Dragon #300) turns a character into Monstrous Humanoid
  with the aquatic subtype at its final level, level 5.
- Shoal Servant (Dragon #300) turns a character into Monstrous Humanoid
  with the aquatic subtype at its final level, level 5.

### Ooze

- Oozemaster (Masters of the Wild) transforms into ooze. 

This prestige class really covers it for ooze, both specific oozes and general
abilities of ooze. The only way you could be more ooze is to abandon all
semblance of humanoid form, such as the bone ooze, a gargantuan lumpy sphere
that just rolls over people and absorbs all their bone.

### Outsider

- The monk (Player's Handbook), a core class, gains outsider type at level 20,
  although is not an outsider of any particular plane. This may be the original
  inspiration for prestige classes that change type at the top level. Tome and
  Blood's PrCs were centered around outsider type.
- Acolyte of the Skin ([Tome and Blood][]) gains the outsider type, becoming
  essentially a fiend.
- Alienist ([Tome and Blood][]) gains the outsider type, becoming somewhat a
  pseudonatural creature.
- Artist's Vengeance (Dragon #307) gains the outsider type at level 5 of 5.
- Aspirant (Dragon #311), a standard class, gains the outsider type at level 20,
  as the monk does.
- Contemplative (Complete Divine) gains outsider type at level 10,
  which given the unusually high prerequisites (Knowledge (religion) 13 ranks)
  will occur at total level 20. This is a particularly good prestige class for
  clerics as it costs only some base attack bonus and turn undead, and gains
  various immunities and spell resistance. It's almost universally better than
  straight cleric to the point that it supplants cleric.
- Divine Crusader (Complete Divine) gains outsider type at level 10.
- Exemplar (Complete Adventurer) gains the outsider type at level 10.
- Fatespinner ([Tome and Blood][]) gains the outsider type, but of no particular
  plane. The updated five-level version of Fatespinner printed in Complete
  Arcane no longer gains outsider type.
- Follower of the Skyserpent (Dragon #307) changes to outsider type at level 5
  of 5.
- Incandescent Champion (Magic of Incarnum) gains the outsider type at level 10.
- Initiate of Pistis Sophia (Book of Exalted Deeds) gains the outsider type at
  level 10.
- Knight of the Sacred Seal (Tome of Magic) gains the outsider type at level 5,
  its final level.
- Tiger Mask (Dragon #300) gains the outsider type at level 5, its final level.
- Troubador of Stars (Book of Exalted Deeds) gains the outsider type at 10th
  level.
- Yuan-Ti Cultist (Savage Species) gains Outsider type at level 10.

Despite this being the largest category by far, it also has the most room for
expansion. You can in practice have the ability to transcend into any individual
plane, as with planetouched races. You can have one for every layer of the Abyss
or each of the Nine Hells, one for each deity, one to become more like each
notable outsider, one of each alignment, and so on.

### Plant

- Verdant Lord (Masters of the Wild) gains the plant type. Along with
  Oozemaster, this book has two of the weirdest things anyone would want to
  transform into.
- Thrall of Zuggtmoy (Dragon #337) is reborn as a fungus at level 10, gaining
  the plant type.

### Undead

- Companion of the Dead (Dragon #315) gains the undead type at level 10.
- Deathwalker (Dragon #312), a standard class, gains the undead type  at level
  20.
- Walker in the Waste (Sandstorm) gains the undead type along with the dry lich
  template.
- Pale Master ([Tome and Blood][]) is an undead apotheosis prestige class,
  except that it doesn't actually grant the undead type. This is perhaps because
  undead is a mechanically radical type change. You jump from d4 hit dice to
  d12, but lose Constitution, usually a net gain. You can't be healed any more,
  unless the cleric prepares special inflict spells just to heal you. An actual
  undead class has problems like this.

A wizard class for transforming into a standard lich is a neat idea, but the
issue is that standard lich is worth level adjustment +4, making it difficult to
spread across levels. For comparison, Dragon Disciple (LA +3) was ten levels,
and that investment crippled the spell ability of any actual sorcerer main who
tried to take it.

Arcane casters benefit the most from being undead, since their hit dice rises to
d12. On average, an undead with d12 and no Con score is as good as a wizard with
d4 hit dice and 18 Con.

### Vermin

- Fang of Lolth (Song and Silence) gains vermin type at level 10. An insane
  prestige class that turns a rogue into a spider creature.

## Subtypes

### Air

Elemental Savant implies that you have this subtype if you take this elemental
path, but doesn't explicitly state it.

### Angel

This is a specific celestial race and not something humanoids generally have the
option to become.

### Aquatic

- Darkwater Scion (Dragon #314) gains the aquatic subtype at level 10.
- Deep Thrall (Dragon #300) turns a character into Monstrous Humanoid
  with the aquatic subtype at its final level, level 5.
- Shoal Servant (Dragon #300) turns a character into Monstrous Humanoid
  with the aquatic subtype at its final level, level 5.
- Thrall of Dagon (Dragon #349) gains the aquatic subtype at level 10.

<!--
It's not a prestige class, but Unearthed Arcana has an aquatic racial variant.
-->

### Archon

This is a specific celestial race and not something humanoids generally have the
option to become.

A lawful-aligned Risen Martyr (Book of Exalted Deeds) is considered an archon
upon reaching level 10, although doesn't doesn't specifically gain that subtype.

### Augmented

This is applied automatically to a creature who changes type due to a template
or the like.

### Chaotic

- The alternate chaos monk standard class (Dragon #335) gains the chaotic
  subtype at level 20.

Alignment-fixing subtypes are rare.

### Cold

- Winterhaunt (Frostburn) gains the cold subtype at level 7.

### Dragonblood

- Dragon Devotee (Races of the Dragon) gains this subtype, which exists for this
  specific book and is not referenced in the core rules.

### Earth

Elemental Savant implies that you have this subtype if you take this elemental
path, but doesn't explicitly state it.

### Evil

- Winterhaunt (Frostburn) gains the evil subtype at level 10. It's rare for a
  prestige class to actually gain an alignment subtype, especially evil. Player
  characters are normally free to decide their alignment, rather than innately
  as suggested by a subtype.

### Extraplanar

Unlikely to be acquired by a prestige class. Extraplanar subtype applies to a
creature who is not on their home plane. Generally, even if a character becomes
outsider type, they also have the native subtype, meaning they can't be
banished. The only way to gain this by a prestige class is if it repatriates
your home plane to some other world.

### Fire

Elemental Savant implies that you have this subtype if you take this elemental
path, but doesn't explicitly state it.

### Goblinoid

None.

### Good

Alignment-fixing subtypes are rare.

### Incarnum

A type introduced in Magic of Incarnum, which only applies to that book. It can
be acquired by taking any class that grants incarnum-based powers.

### Incorporeal

Too powerful for a player character to gain permanently. You'd be immune to most
damage and be able to pass through walls. Not even the ghost sourcebook
Ghostwalk has this subtype.

### Lawful

Alignment-fixing subtypes are rare.

### Native

Widely applied by any class that grants outsider type. It prevents you from
being banished while on your home plane, and you can automatically assume you're
native to your home plane even if you're an outsider.

### Reptilian

None.

### Shapechanger

- Faceless One (Dragon #300) gains the shapechanger subtype at level 5, its
  final level.
- Master Transmogrifist (Complete Arcane) gains the Shapechanger subtype at
  level 5. This is rare in that it's granted halfway through the prestige class
  instead of at the end.
- Primeval (Frostburn) gains the shapechanger subtype at level 10.
- Shapeshifter (Oriental Adventures, per errata in Dragon #318) gains the
  shapechanger subtype.

### Swarm

This would be a very peculiar transformation. It's not entirely without
precedent; the Worm that Walks is a mass of undead worms in humanoid form.

### Water

Elemental Savant implies that you have this subtype if you take this elemental
path, but doesn't explicitly state it.

## Footnotes

[^1]:
    Completionism is the uninventive, but useful process of extrapolating
    a set of existing game content out to its logical conclusion, for no real
    reason but to fill in gaps in that set and create new content easily. For
    example, the neutral evil yugoloths seem to exist simply as a counterpart to
    the lawful evil devils and chaotic evil demons. We might also call this
    general trend "expansionism".
