_Of course_ they do economic spying.

Britain's [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000)
(RIPA), the law which makes mass surveillance legal,
explicitly allows the use of surveillance "for the purpose of
safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom".

The [Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Retention_and_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2014)
(DRIP) included provisions to prevent data gathering for purely
economic purposes. The UK was forced to pass DRIP after the European
Court repealed UK spy agencies' access to records acquired via mass
surveillance.

Greenwald's link shows New Zealand using spying software XKEYSCORE to
scan all e-mail for information on candidates for Director-General of
the World Trade Organization. Under DRIP, it would now be illegal for
the UK to make this scan unless it was also necessary for national
security or the prevention of crime, but DRIP does not apply to other
countries like the US or NZ with whom the UK could trade for information.

The special value of a mass surveillance system is that if you can read
everyone's e-mail, you can scan it all for information of interest like
this, rather than targeting only known accounts.

The spy agencies claim that this respects privacy because staff don't
leaf through everyone's e-mail, but only search for keywords and then
leaf through those results. Technically you have privacy, unless you
communicate certain words or phrases or to certain people, and the
prohibited phrases and people are a state secret, as is the fact
that our governments routinely copy and search everyone's e-mail.

This amounts to a "general warrant", something outlawed long ago in
the US by the [Fourth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution),
specifically to protect citizens from unreasonable search of their
private papers and property by British agents. More than 200 years
later, British agents are once again free to read American citizens'
private communications.

Even earlier, English law established in 1765 that Britain (and hence
also the US, who inherited the English legal system) has no right to
search or seize documents without specific probable cause:

> Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden ruled that both the search and the
> seizure was unlawful, as the warrant authorized the seizure of all
> of Entick's papers—not just the criminal ones—and as the warrant
> lacked probable cause to even justify the search.

The Fourth Amendment was written because Colonial American law was
biased toward British tax revenue and economic interests rather than the
freedom and privacy of American citizens, something which sparked the
Boston Tea Party and contributed to the demand for American independence.

Yet here in 2015 our governments are violating these centuries-established
basic rights for the same economic reasons, and hardly anyone takes notice.
