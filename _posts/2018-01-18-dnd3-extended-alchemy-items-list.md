## Observations

It's interesting how authors independently create the same types of items.
Common items are flashbangs, acids which dissolve stone, vermin repellant, smoke
which causes nausea, truth serum, water purification, anti-exhaustion, invisible
ink, and light sources. There's a tendency to create D&D versions of modern
technology.

A frequent error writers made was to forget to include a craft DC.

In several instances, the same item appears in multiple books.

Alchemy items are generally like weak magic items. They tend to be less than 100
gp in price, with no item over 1,000 gp. It's awkward that alchemy requires a
skill while magic item creation requires feats, and by the time you can craft
reliably, the benefit of saving money by making your own alchemy items is
insignificant.

The most difficult alchemy items to craft are DC 35: Dragon Magazine #301's
icewalker oil and night venom, and Complete Adventurer's ghostblight, strongarm
and swiftstride capsules.

However, epic level alchemy allows creating improved items by increasing the DC
by 20 or more, such as DC 40 for augmented alchemist's fire. Since you can keep
increasing the DC by 20, the maximum DC is unlimited.

A clever alchemist will try to invent his own items. Just about any effect is
possible, as long as a magic item of the same power wouldn't cost more than
about 500 gp. The major advantage over magic item creation is that it doesn't
cost XP, and doesn't require an item creation feat (though of course it still
requires investment of skill points).

Some further alchemy items appear in Pathfinder RPG, notably in the Pathfinder
SRD under [Advanced Gear](https://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedPlayersGuide/advancedGear.html).
Also useful are the alchemist's kit (25 gp, 5 lb, no bonus) and portable
alchemist's lab (75 gp, 20 lbs, +1 bonus), which serve as portable alternatives
to standard D&D alchemist's lab (500 gp, 40 lbs, +2 bonus). These make Craft
(Alchemy) more useful since you can craft items mid-adventure.
