Some politicians have taken the Paris attacks to push the idea that citizens
should be banned from using encryption, or that the encryption everyone uses
should be weakened somehow.

Basic technical knowledge says this won't work.

1. ISIS are evidently capable of supplying members with explosive vests and
firearms. Sending encryption software would be considerably easier.
2. ISIS already have their own encryption software. Even if standard encryption
services were weakened, terrorist communication would still be secure.
3. Weakening the security of all ordinary citizens increases their risk of crime
and terrorism, on a national or even global scale.
