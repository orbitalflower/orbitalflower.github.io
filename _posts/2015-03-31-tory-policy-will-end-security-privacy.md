If Britain's Conservative party wins the general election in May, their plans
to outlaw strong cryptography will have disastrous consequences for both the
security and privacy of its citizens.

In March, an unexplained glitch caused British internet traffic to be
[incorrectly routed via Ukraine](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/03/mysterious-snafu-hijacks-uk-nukes-makers-traffic-through-ukraine/).
Affected users included the Atomic Weapons Establishment and Lockheed Martin.

It could have been an innocent routing error. But if it was triggered
intentionally, it's likely that data from those customers was intercepted by a
foreign intelligence agency. Any data not protected by strong encryption would
now be in the hands of a foreign power.

But in Britain, the Conservative Party has promised to make this necessary
strong encryption illegal.

British and American intelligence agencies have
[undermined crypto strength for decades](https://www.bestvpn.com/blog/8312/nsa-backdoors-history/),
dating back to World War II when they sold captured German Enigma machines
to their allies without revealing that they could decrypt its output.

The goal of these agencies is "Nobody but us": US and its allies secretly
weaken strong crypto systems so that, in theory, they can decrypt messages
that nobody else can.

It's dangerously arrogant. Security researchers frequently discover flaws in
[secure systems](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/12/ss7_vulnerabili.html),
and it's ludicrous to assume we're the only country with
codebreakers. State secrets can be stolen or leaked. Computers get faster
and cheaper every year. Capabilities that used to be "nobody but us" are
now "[anybody with $100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FREAK)".

Not only will a ban on strong encryption endanger the security and privacy of
anyone whose data travels through the UK, there's absolutely no reason to
assume it will do anything to stop the bad guys.

Immediately after the Charlie Hebdo bombings in January 2015, David Cameron
advertised his plans to outlaw any cryptography the UK can't crack, supposedly
to protect against terrorists.

But the Charlie Hebdo bombers didn't use encrypted internet messaging - they
met in person. Nor did Al Qaeda, who used trusted couriers.

David Cameron exploiting the Charlie Hebdo massacre to promote his political
agenda was like watching a man try to sell car insurance at a funeral.

Banning strong crypto won't stop GCHQ's targets: terrorists don't rely on
crypto, foreign nations are unaffected by UK law, and criminals will have
no trouble downloading this widely available free software.

But it will stop normal citizens from exercising their legal right to
communicate in private, a right which the UK has spent the last ten
years eroding in secret.

## What Britain does with your unencrypted data

This is the real reason the UK government is frightened of encryption. If
normal people start using it, the government would lose its
no-warrant-necessary bulk access to the private communications of its own
law-abiding citizens - the only people a UK-wide strong encryption ban would
affect.

But by forcing people to use unencrypted or weakened communication systems,
the government leaves everyone vulnerable to digital threats.
