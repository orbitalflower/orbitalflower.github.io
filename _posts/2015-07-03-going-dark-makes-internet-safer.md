Recently, the FBI has made it a top priority to coerce social media companies
into weakening their security, over fears that the widespread use of end-to-end
encryption will block their ability to intercept people's messages. They call
this problem "going dark".

"Going dark" is the FBI's problem, not ours.

Most people's problem is that the communications systems we use are not secure
enough.

The Internet is, fundamentally, an unsecured network. You don't control the
route your data takes or the nodes on that route. You cannot prevent the service
provider being hacked. You can't fix security flaws in mobile internet
standards or stop criminals intercepting your phonecalls and text messages with
easily available equipment.

But that insecure system is still the best we have, and we still want to send
private messages. The only practical way to do that is with communication
software that uses such strong encryption that has no known way of being broken.
People have every right to use such software even if it makes the FBI's job more
difficult in the long run, since privacy is a basic human right but solving
crimes is not.

If your comms software is "dark" to the FBI, that's excellent news for you
because it means it's also dark to the multitude of genuine threats: criminals,
stalkers, identity thieves, blackmailers, hackers, foreign agents, industrial
spies and eavesdroppers, to name a few.

It's only "going dark" from the perspective of the FBI and malicious actors.
From everyone else's point of view, it's making the Internet safe.
