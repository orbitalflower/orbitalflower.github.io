In 1856, an African prophet named Nongqawuse told her people that if
they slaughtered their cattle and destroyed their crops, the spirits
of the tribe's ancestors would sweep the British invaders into the
sea.

In those days, the people believed in the almighty power of witchcraft,
because they did not know any better. They sacrificed most of their
cattle, but the enemies were not driven out. Instead, the people
suffered famine and poverty, and lost most of their land.

In 2015, a former television director named David Cameron told his
people that if they banned encryption and allowed the government to
spy on all private citizens, the terrorists would be defeated and
their country would be safe again.

In those days, the people believe in the almighty power of surveillance,
because they did not know any better. They sacrificed most of their
basic human rights, but the terrorists were not defeated. Instead,
the people suffered economic hardship, and lost most of their freedom.

**Update:** My apologies to any witch doctors who were offended by the
comparison to David cameron.
