description: The origins of a misheard lyric in Final Fantasy VII.
---

__Myth:__ _One-Winged Angel_, Sephiroth's theme in _Final Fantasy VII_, contains
the lyric "haryuu no hanekata", meaning "winged one of the lower reaches".

__Fact:__ The correct lyrics to this misheard line are "gloriosa, generosa".
This is true in all versions of the song, including the Japanese game, with the
exception of the rendition in _Advent Children_ which changed the song's lyrics
entirely.

## Evidence

### 1. It's not correct Japanese

Neither the words "haryuu" nor "hanekata" are real Japanese words.

### 2. It's not supported by any Japanese sources

Various Japanese sources concur with the lyric "gloriosa, generosa". This
includes [a Japanese fansite](http://www.geocities.jp/lune_monogatari/boom/sephiroth.html), [a Pixiv page](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E7%89%87%E7%BF%BC%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%A9%E4%BD%BF), and [a Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cWuI1_pLpE&t=3m35s).

Conversely, the only verbatim Google hit for "haryuu no hanekata" as written in
hiragana is the English-language talk page for the Wikipedia entry on One-Winged
Angel.

This appears to disprove the unlikely hypothesis that the line only appeared in
the Japanese version and was changed to Latin for the English version.

### 3. It's not pronounced correctly

In Japanese, "ryu" is a single syllable, pronounced to rhyme with "view". In
Japanese, "haryuu" would be pronounced "ha-ryu-u", and not, as misheard,
"ha-ri-yuu".

The "ri" you hear is correct, as it's the second syllable in "glo-ri-o-sa".
There's no "ri" in "haryuu", and only a non-Japanese speaker could make that
mistake.

### 4. Why would it be Japanese?

The rest of the song is in Latin. There's no logical reason to insert one
line in Japanese. It's even less logical to swap it out for Latin for the
English release, as one unlikely hypothesis suggests.

### 5. You can hear the audio sample

In the mid-90s, computing limitations meant that game soundtracks were generally
tracked audio, meaning that each instrument and vocal would be stored
separately.

A website called The Northern Crater has the lyrics to
[One Winged Angel](http://archive.thegia.com/andrea/tnc/aod/owa.html),
and settles the argument by supplying the audio sample ripped directly from the
PC version. The sample clearly says "gloriosa, generosa".

## How the wrong lyric came about

It's difficult to find who originated this misheard lyric; perhaps some USENET
poster in the late 90s to early 2000s, and even if they could be tracked down
they may well have forgotten. Nevertheless, we can speculate.

The Japanese title of _One-Winged Angel_ is 「片翼の天使」, or _Katayoku no
Tenshi_.  It's entirely possible that someone wildly misread the kanji on this
title, and assumed it was the mysterious missing lyric - the hardest to hear,
and the hardest to find in _Carmina Burana_.

Suppose they misunderstood that Japanese is read right-to-left, and thus read
the title as 「使天の翼片」. The middle hiragana "no" and the last kanji "kata"
are the easiest to correctly read. The fourth character, "yoku", meaning wing,
is incorrectly back-translated to "hane", which also means wing.

The second character means "heaven", and is easy to read correctly. The first
could have been misread as 悪, as in "warui" meaning "evil", but they misused
the rule that "wa" is written "ha". They misinterpret this as "evil heaven", or
rather "hell", and as was popular in AD&D 2nd edition (late 90s) they avoid
saying "hell" by calling it "the lower planes" -- but "plane" is a D&D specific
term, so they say "lower reaches".

Turning back to the audio to pick out the second character, since it can't
literally be "ten", they mishear "ryuu", a familiar sound used in the name of
a Street Fighter character. They assume it's just an unfamiliar reading of "ten"
and call it complete.

Our mystery author thus hears "haryuu no hanekata", and mistranslates it as
"winged one(?) of the lower reaches". They assume, not entirely unreasonably,
that the song's title makes sense to appear in the lyrics somewhere. Most RPG
fans don't speak Latin, and the lyrics (most easily recognised from Carmina
Burana) are accurate apart from this one line, so the misheard lyric spreads.

This hypothesis is plausible when you consider how few resources Internet users
had in the late 1990s. There was no Google Translate, Wikipedia or Youtube, and
accurate information about foreign-language material was hard to find.
