Some better qualified commentators have weighed in on the UK's [Draft IP
bill](https://orbitalflower.github.io/20151104-draft-ip-bill-fake-judicial-oversight.html).

The Intercept's first reaction to the bill agrees with my own. The law will
formally allow unprecedented mass surveillance against the world, including
innocent citizens of the UK and its allies. The oversight requirements and
privacy requirements are extremely weak, and largely a sham from a government
who has previously threatened to pull out of the European Union in order to
repeal human rights legislation.

The Intercept previously reported that GCHQ already collects people's browsing
history. The legal basis is a secret interpretation of the Telecommunications
Act 1984, which gives the Secretary of State unlimited authority to take any
measures deemed necessary in the interests of national security. The new IP Bill
will make the existing mass surveillance arrangements explicitly legal.

Although the bill doesn't ban encryption, The Intercept notes that the law is so
vaguely defined that it could be used to force any company with UK customers or
any UK presence to backdoor their own encryption on demand.

The new bill prohibits spying on journalists without a warrant, but an exception
allows British intelligence agencies to ignore that rule completely. Gallagher
notes that this is weaker than the protections in the US.

Police requesting customer metadata will essentially be able to write their own
warrants.

UK Human Rights Blog is concerned that the Investigatory Powers Commissioner
(IPC), who "may be the single most significant factor in the success of the new
arrangements", may be unable to handle the multiple responsibilities placed on
it. "The proposal expects the IPC as a whole to be a self-critical, reflexive,
institution in a field where such a culture has proven difficult to create and
sustain."

It's also skeptical about the role of the Judicial Commissioner, whose job is
merely to review warrants signed by the Home Secretary, not to decide whether or
not a warrant should be granted. The Home Secretary also has the ability to
bypass the Judicial Commissioner if she declares the warrant is urgent.

Interestingly, UK Human Rights Blog gives a figure that 2,500 such Home
Secretary warrants were issued last year, or 48 per calendar week. If Theresa
May spent only ten minutes deciding whether to approve each warrant, she would
have to spend a full working day per week signing warrants. The IPC would have
to spend at least that long applying scrutiny to the warrants, in addition to
the office's other responsibilities.

The bill ignores the recommendations of the Anderson Report and the UN Special
Rapporteur that only an independent judge should sign off on surveillance
warrants. The UK cabinet refuses to do this, and GCHQ calls it their biggest
concern because many of their operations only get approved because no judge ever
looks at the warrant.

UK Human Rights Blog is also critical of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal
(IPT), "the only court of tribunal with jurisdiction over the intelligence
agencies, and it is a deeply flawed institution." Proceedings are often closed
to the public and even to the claimants' lawyers, making a fair trial
impossible.

This analysis of the bill spots very interesting details:

### Nothing's changed

* The Secretary of State's 1984 power to order telecommunications providers to
do literally anything in the interests of national security remains. This
explicitly includes providing _any facility or service_, or stripping any
electronic protection (encryption) applied by _any_ telecommunications operator.
Refusal is punishable by up two two years in prison.
* "Telecommunications operator" is intentionally vaguely defined, and could
potentially be interpreted in secret as any website, app or service. The UK
government indicates that it can and will interpret this as broadly as
possible if allowed.
* Mass surveillance is explicitly legal.
* The Secretary of State will continue to sign off on warrants. The judicial
commissioner has only limited powers of oversight.

### Continued secrecy

* Telecommunications operators must continue to assist in hacking operations,
including mass hacking operations, and keep it secret.
* Whistleblowing will be punishable by a fine or up to two years in prison.
* Data gathered by intelligence will continue to be inadmissable in court.
* Warrants will continue to be secret.

### Foreign vs domestic

* Foreign companies can be compelled to comply with surveillance warrants,
providing the company has a UK address, UK customers, or part of its network
operates within the UK. Failure to comply is punishable by a fine or up to two
years in prison.
* MI5, MI6, GCHQ and the MoD may hack anyone globally without a warrant,
including bulk hacking, as long as neither the hacking agent nor the equipment
targeted are in the UK, and the purpose is not to obtain information sent to,
by, or relating to a person currently in the UK.
* Economic surveillance outside the UK is still legal, if related to national
security.

### Data vs metadata

* Metadata collection is considered "necessary and proportionate" in several
circumstances unrelated to crime or national security, including tax collection,
regulation of the financial market,s public health, and identifying next of kin
of the deceased.
* Telecommunications operators (again, not properly defined in law) can be
secretly compelled to retain communications metadata for up to 12 months. This
specifically includes any information that can identify a communication's
sender, recipient, method, time, duration, IP address, and the identity and
location of systems it travels through.

### Confusing wordplay

* A "targeted" warrant may apply to more than one person, as long as they're part
of the same investigation or operation, or share a common purpose or carry on a
particular activity. It can also be used to test new bulk surveillance systems,
or to authorise data not authorised in the warrant in certain circumstances.
* "Interception" is defined as the collection of content, not metadata.
* "Examination" of intercepted data only occurs when a human examines it.
Computer analysis if content is not examination.
* A targeted interception warrant also authorises activity not described in the
warrant
* "Data" includes any information which is not data.
