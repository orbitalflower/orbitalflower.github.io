description: "An analysis of the D&D 3.5 Eberron Campaign Setting in the context of contemporary progressive values."
---

Recently, a hot-button topic in the Dungeons & Dragons community is a perceived
shift to signal support for highly progressive social values. The most recent
announcement, at time of writing, is the intent to remove the half-elf and
half-orc, believing them to be inherently racist. This has taken a lot of the
D&D community by surprise.

The following article is not about that issue, per se, and I do not intend to
answer it in this article. Rather, it brings to mind a D&D campaign setting
which made the half-elf a major race: Eberron. In retrospect, it may be the
setting which holds up best overall in today's political climate.

### Eberron's predecessors

The first Advanced Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting published by TSR was Gary
Gygax's _The World of Greyhawk_ (1980). A review by Kenneth W. Burke in Dragon
magazine #46 spoke highly of the book in general, but had a particular criticism
of the use of the term "savages", a term evidently offensive already in 1980,
not just the "woke" 2020s. Burke wrote:

TSR's vice president of product development Lawrence Schick responded in the
same issue:

> As regards the savages, nowhere in the text of the Gazetteer is there any

That attitude was revised in the 1983 _World of Greyhawk_ boxed set, which
definitively established major human ethnic groups of different skin tones, as
well as that mixture between these groups is the norm. For example:

It may surprise even many players of D&D that most characters are canonically
what modern America would consider "non-white". The monochrome art of historic
adventure modules certainly seemed to depict most characters as pale-skinned.

Deliberate inclusivity in D&D is hardly a new invention, and certainly dates
back at least forty years.

Still, other elements of that setting, and AD&D in general, draw scrutiny today.
Many cultural elements are convenient stereotypes of real-world cultures. The
drow, dark-skinned elves, are all evil and matriarchal. The orcs, violent and
brutish by nature, are re-interpreted today as stereotypes of African-Americans.
In 2023, long-standing D&D rules like alignment, racial ability score modifiers,
and even the term "race" are on the way out.

### Eberron Campaign Setting (2004)

The original 
[Eberron Campaign Setting](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/28474/Eberron-Campaign-Setting-3e)
in 2004 brought with it a clean slate. Nowadays there are dozens of first-party
Eberron sourcebooks and novels, plus blog posts by the Keith Baker that fill in
many of the blanks. But in 2004, the _Eberron Campaign Setting_ provided a
single sourcebook as a framework for a campaign setting, and nothing yet existed
to contradict the DM's free development of a campaign in that world.

At first glance, Eberron has elements which can be seen as problematic. There
are references to sexual assault in the core pantheon of gods. The world's
morality in general is flexible and vaguely defined, and the overall tone is
intentionally darker than standard Dungeons & Dragons&mdash;evil heroes are most
at home in Eberron, and more often must make difficult moral choices. The main
continent of Khorvaire was taken from its original inhabitants and colonized by
humans centuries ago, certainly an intentional historic parallel to the European
colonization of the Americas.

Despite all that, this nearly twenty year old campaign setting manages to hold
up well to the updated standards of morality being embraced by Wizards of the
Coast in 2023.

### Eberron on race

The half-elves of Eberron are a species with their own society and culture,
tracing their ancestry in the continent of Khorvaire for centuries.
An official 2004 _Dragonshard_ article even gives them their own name, the
[Khoravar](https://web.archive.org/web/20161101150302/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebds/20040906a), which would be used by later books.
Most are descended from Khoravar parents, rather than the rare offspring of
a human and an elf as in traditional D&D.

The half-orcs have a controversial history in Dungeons & Dragons: firstly the
distasteful implication that they are usually the offspring of an unwilling
pairing of an orc raider and a human woman, and secondly that the brutish orcs
and half-orcs are nowadays compared to stereotypes of black men. Eberron instead
depicts half-orcs as primarily descended from human settlers of orc territory,
where the two species live with mutual respect.

In many contexts, sentience and rights are explicitly recognized for humanoid
species, even those traditionally considered monsters, such as kobolds, goblins
and orcs. According to _Sharn: City of Towers_, the protection of the law
applies to beings of all the major nations, including the Eldeen Reaches (3%
orc) and the goblin nation Darguun (13% bugbears). The city of Sharn has some 9%
goblinoid population, where they are very much workers rather than targets. This
is a radical departure from early D&D tradition, where traditional non-playable
species were largely monsters to be killed without moral complication.

(In researching this article, I realized that had incorrectly recalled that
monstrous humanoids in general, such as ogres and medusas, also benefited from
the rights of sentient peoples in Sharn, but it is elsewhere stated that the
monster kingdom of Droaam do not have rights because their nation did not sign
the Treaty of Thronehold, though a gnoll from that realm is still subject to the
laws of Sharn if they visit. In retrospect, it seems bizarre that a gnoll living
in the city should not be protected by laws against murder.)

For human characters, written description of human skin tone is intentionally
avoided. There are nationalities, and humans of various skin tone are depicted
in art, but there is no talk of discrete ethnic groups like in Greyhawk. And why
should there be? D&D is a game told primarily through speech or text, and set in
a completely fantastical world. The skin tone of any given NPC is hardly
relevant. "Race", in the 20th century meaning of divisions in human ethnicity
based largely on skin tone, is not a meaningful part of Eberron.

### Eberron on alignment

Alignment, too, is a hot-button issue, and there was a period around the
publication of _Tasha's Cauldron of Everything_ where Wizards of the Coast
omitted alignment from monster statblocks. The notion is that if we say that a
certain creature tends to be good or evil, it invites comparison to racist
stereotypes of black Americans which claim a tendency to commit crimes. As I
recall, Wizards has since scaled this back to allow monsters to have alignment,
but not race entries; e.g. dwarves will no longer tend to be lawful good. Even
in 2014, D&D 5th edition's _Player's Handbook_ did not include alignment-based
_detect evil_ as a spell or paladin ability.

Eberron was already ahead of the curve by a good decade on this one. In order to
add moral complexity, the essential nature of alignment was reduced. A cleric
of a good deity can be evil, and a chromatic dragon can be good. An evil
NPC can do good deeds, and a hero can justify immoral acts.

D&D 3.5 in general also had a more nuanced alignment system than 5e. Orcs, for
example, are "often chaotic evil", with "often" defined in the _Monster Manual_
glossary as 40-50%, with exceptions common. "Usually" means over 50%, and in
both cases here the alignment may be either nature or nurture. "Always" means
practically 100%.

### Summary

I do not imagine that, at any point in its history, the writers of Dungeons &
Dragons were intentionally writing racist content, or would have understood
themselves to be doing so. In many cases, through their works or social media
activity, writers have explicitly signalled progressive attitudes.

But certainly, we must admit that any game will inherit some amount of the
authors' unconscious bias, and D&D was designed by white Americans in the 1970s,
inspired by works by mostly white male authors, in turn drawing mostly on
northern European myth and history. LGBT representation was extremely rare, and
D&D adventure modules represented a male-dominated society.

In 2023, there are concerns from some quarters that certain D&D traditions are
incompatible with the latest trends in progressive ideology. An increasing
segment of the playerbase is uncomfortable with fictional elements that remind
them of real-world issues of race prevalent in the United States today.

Eberron, by some ratio of design and accident, turns out to have been perhaps
the most progressive D&D setting from the beginning. There is no moral
essentialism based on species, no outmoded concept of race in the context of
human beings, no facile morality or reduction of sentient humanoids to monsters.
It was somehow so forward-thinking twenty years ago, and I don't think it gets
enough credit for that.
