When I am ruler, the following changes will be made for the betterment of
society.

1. It will be illegal to converse via bluetooth headset within 30 feet of
   another person without the universal signal of holding two fingers to one
   ear.
2. To encourage people to eat breakfast, hot food sold before 11am will be
   tax-free.
3. The Naked Rambler will be pardoned and promoted to the House of Lords.

7. Video game speedruns will be an Olympic sport.
8. Classes on basic life skills like how to file taxes will be mandatory.
9. Effort must be made to preserve movies and their playback technology for
   future generations, for at least 250 years. This is specifically so that
   mankind can watch _Babylon 5_ in 2258 and _Star Trek_ in 2264.
10. In case attempts to preserve HD video for 250 years fail, the scripts of
    the best _Star Trek_ episodes will be converted into stage plays and
    written on clay tablets hidden around the world.
11. Cosplay outfits will be exempt from import tax.
12. My secret assassin squad will quietly remove world leaders who are "being a
    dick".
13. If anyone dies of natural causes aboard a space station, their body will be
    dropped onto the planet with a GoPro camera attached, "just to see what
    happens".
14. Probes will be sent directly "up" and "down" relative to the galactic plane,
    so as to send future generations photographs of the shape of our galaxy.
15. NASA will search for signals coming from directly above and below us on the
    galactic plane, in case an ancient civilization already did this.
16. Clay tablets will be left on Mars just to confuse future astronauts.
17. All bicycles will have GPS trackers to prevent theft.
18. All weapons will be engraved with the year of construction to aid
    historians.
19. All games consoles must release their DRM keys after 30 years to aid
    the use of emulators and homebrew software.
20. Any number divided by zero is defined as zero. This will prevent
    numerous computer crashes.
21. All _Monopoly_ boxes in shops will be emptied out and filled with
    copies of superior board game _Machi Koro_.
22. It will be illegal to pass a law that's named the exact opposite of what it
    does. Anyone who votes for such a law shall be given an appropriately
    ironic punishment.
23. To encourage recycling, shops must accept used batteries as legal currency.
24. White people will henceforth be known as beige people.
25. Airport security will increase the limit of 150ml of liquid to 250ml to
    allow people to bring cans of Red Bull.

    mirror-coated to reflect sunlight, and left at one of the Lagrangian
    points.
32. Copies of Stonehenge will be built in the wilderness just to confuse future
    historians.
33. Grants will be offered to develop fusion technology. We're overdue.
34. Kung fu will be taught to all citizens to allow people to defend
    themselves. Crime will still happen, but at least the resulting fights
    will look cooler.
35. For future generations, the secrets of writing on clay tablets will,
    themselves, be stored on clay tablets.
36. Leaving a shop without buying something will be illegal. Shops will sell
    inexpensive goods to account for this.
37. As a corollary, shoving people into expensive shops will be illegal.
38. It will be illegal to employ a retail worker while they have a cold.
39. Signmakers will be required to hire a proofreader.

    but looks easy" or "easy, but looks hard".
41. All women's clothes will be required to contain pockets.
42. Video games will not be allowed to call their game "New (original title)".
    It won't make any sense when New Super Mario Bros is old.

    and that Doom (2016) was newer than Doom II (1994).

    electrics.

    length in centimetres.

    dice.

    room and watching how much a test subject eats in an hour.

50. Richard Stallman will get his own TV show.
51. Tipping will be forbidden.
52. All prices will include sales tax.
53. All citizens will be measured for clothing on a regular basis. Measuring
    will be paid for by the government, but this policy will pay for itself
    with the new jobs created in the bespoke clothing industry.

55. It will be illegal to play or perform "Let It Go" from Frozen in public.

65. Subsidies shall be given to cover all that empty land in the United States
    with trees. It worked for Dark Ages Europe.

    themselves be flame grilled.
68. For ease of cooking instructions, all microwave ovens will be standardized
    at 800 watts.

    "Nice".

    shall be heavily taxed to fund public art education so that future
    generations will not create something like Funko Pops.
71. Any forms which require my subjects to fill in their name will place the
    first name first and surname last.
72. There shall be a Nobel Prize for Discovering Interesting Glitches in
    Videogames.

    people of the new law with a catchy slogan: "Don't be a dick!"
74. March 1 shall be celebrated annually as X-COM Day.
75. The tradition of inventing fake news stories on April Fools day is
    abolished. False news isn't a joke, because jokes are funny.
76. April 1st shall be made a day for wearing amusing costumes. It's at the
