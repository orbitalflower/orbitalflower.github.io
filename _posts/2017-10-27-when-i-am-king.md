When I am ruler, the following changes will be made for the betterment of
society.

1. It will be illegal to converse via bluetooth headset within 30 feet of
   another person without the universal signal of holding two fingers to one
   ear.
2. To encourage people to eat breakfast, hot food sold before 11am will be
   tax-free.
3. The Naked Rambler will be pardoned and promoted to the House of Lords.
4. A government grant will be supplied to fund a GUI for Dwarf Fortress.
5. Phone manufacturers will have to supply security updates for at least five
   years.
6. It will be illegal to use Javascript to awkwardly replicate features that
   are already provided by HTML.
7. Video game speedruns will be an Olympic sport.
8. Classes on basic life skills like how to file taxes will be mandatory.
9. Effort must be made to preserve movies and their playback technology for
   future generations, for at least 250 years. This is specifically so that
   mankind can watch _Babylon 5_ in 2258 and _Star Trek_ in 2264.
10. In case attempts to preserve HD video for 250 years fail, the scripts of
    the best _Star Trek_ episodes will be converted into stage plays and
    written on clay tablets hidden around the world.
11. Cosplay outfits will be exempt from import tax.
12. My secret assassin squad will quietly remove world leaders who are "being a
    dick".
13. If anyone dies of natural causes aboard a space station, their body will be
    dropped onto the planet with a GoPro camera attached, "just to see what
    happens".
14. Probes will be sent directly "up" and "down" relative to the galactic plane,
    so as to send future generations photographs of the shape of our galaxy.
15. NASA will search for signals coming from directly above and below us on the
    galactic plane, in case an ancient civilization already did this.
16. Clay tablets will be left on Mars just to confuse future astronauts.
17. All bicycles will have GPS trackers to prevent theft.
18. All weapons will be engraved with the year of construction to aid
    historians.
19. All games consoles must release their DRM keys after 30 years to aid
    the use of emulators and homebrew software.
20. Any number divided by zero is defined as zero. This will prevent
    numerous computer crashes.
21. All _Monopoly_ boxes in shops will be emptied out and filled with
    copies of superior board game _Machi Koro_.
22. It will be illegal to pass a law that's named the exact opposite of what it
    does. Anyone who votes for such a law shall be given an appropriately
    ironic punishment.
23. To encourage recycling, shops must accept used batteries as legal currency.
24. White people will henceforth be known as beige people.
25. Airport security will increase the limit of 150ml of liquid to 250ml to
    allow people to bring cans of Red Bull.
26. The phrase "begging the question" is forbidden. Henceforth you must
    specify either "raises the question" or "circular reasoning".
27. Dungeon Masters will receive a government subsidy to pay for adventure
    modules, miniatures and non-standard dice.
28. _Master of Orion II_ shall be added to the school syllabus.
29. For future generations, the rules to chess, shogi, mahjong and
    _Dungeons & Dragons_ will be written on clay tablets.
30. Twitter will be nationalized, then ordered to show tweets in chronological
    order.
31. Records of the entirety of human culture shall be loaded into a giant chest,
    mirror-coated to reflect sunlight, and left at one of the Lagrangian
    points.
32. Copies of Stonehenge will be built in the wilderness just to confuse future
    historians.
33. Grants will be offered to develop fusion technology. We're overdue.
34. Kung fu will be taught to all citizens to allow people to defend
    themselves. Crime will still happen, but at least the resulting fights
    will look cooler.
35. For future generations, the secrets of writing on clay tablets will,
    themselves, be stored on clay tablets.
