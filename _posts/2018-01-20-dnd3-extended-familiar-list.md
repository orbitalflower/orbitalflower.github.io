Notes:

- The alignment shown is that of the familiar; the caster's alignment must be
  within one step on each axis, e.g. any caster can take a True Neutral (N)
  familiar. (Later D&D books confirm this interpretation.)
- An exception is where it says "only", in which case the caster's alignment
  must match exactly, e.g. only a NE caster can have a sanguine imp familiar,
  and only LG, LN or LE casters can take a modron familiar.
- Casters must also meet the level requirement listed. Those marked "B" require
  the caster to also have a base attack bonus equal to the level requirement,
  e.g. a wizard must be level 6 to reach the +3 base attack necessary for a worg
  familiar.
- Characters with a type or subtype may take a familiar of that type/subtype,
  even if they don't meet the alignment requirements.
- "Standard familiar" refers to any animal on the standard familiar list that
  the caster could normally take.
- Guardian familiars (Complete Warrior p118-121) have special rules, including
  that they must be crafted by the caster as per a magic item.
- This list is not exclusive. Any creature of approximately the same power of an
  existing improved familiar could be an improved familiar.

__Improved standard familiars__: Dragon #331 features rules giving improved
special abilities to characters who take the Improved Familiar feat but keep
their standard familiar.

## Improved familiars, Pathfinder

The following familiar appear in Pathfinder sources, which, while not official
Dungeons & Dragons material, are largely compatible with D&D. This list is not
necessarily complete.

## Creating new familiars

In general, any creature with approximately the same statistics as a standard
familiar is acceptable as a familiar. In general, that means a 1HD animal no
larger than Tiny.

Any creature which does not appear in the rulebooks can be represented using the
stats for another existing familiar.

A familiar's bonus should generally be either +3 to a non-class skill, +3 hit
points, or +2 to one saving throw. The ability should match the creature, such
as a cat granting Move Silently.

Anything more powerful or unusual than this requires the Improved Familiar feat.
In that case, existing improved familiars should be used as a benchmark.
Approximately, any CR3 or lower creature of any type is suitable, as long as it
is no larger than Small and has no abilities beyond a normal character at the
level where they can be acquired, and no abilities that would be game-breaking
in the hands of a player character.

Any standard familiar with the Celestial or Fiendish template or another
template based on those (e.g. Axiomatic, Pseudodatural) is probably suitable as
an improved familiar.
