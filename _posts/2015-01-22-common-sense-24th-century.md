I never understood why Starfleet had such a problem with genetic engineering.

Human society in the 24th Century is widely accepting of advanced technology.
Starfleet outfits its ships with antimatter drive, food replicators, and a
deflector dish that can do seemingly anything from detecting cloaked ships
to repairing the structure of entire planets.

The Federation always seemed pretty open-minded and egalitarian, too.
Starfleet captains adhere to an impeccable set of moral standards, including
respect for life and tolerance of other cultures.

But sometimes, in a few very specific sets of circumstance, they throw all
common sense out of the nearest airlock.

## Genetic engineering is forbidden

According to Star Trek lore, genetically engineered super-humans started
a global war in 1992, and for the next 400 years everyone decided that genetic
manipulation was worse than murder. 

Never mind the benefits: super-intelligent scientists and tacticians who can
come up with ways to defeat any alien threat, super-accurate marksmen,
and cures for every genetic disease. The Federation doesn't want to save
billions of lives if it means living alongside people with vastly superior
physical strength and mental acuity (...except that they already do: they're
called _Vulcans_).

__Actual reason:__ There's a logical out-of-universe explanation. If genetic
modification wasn't banned, Star Trek would be a show about superhuman creatures
who solve every problem with ease. The viewers can't relate to characters who
don't have human limitations and flaws.

## The Prime Directive

A populated planet is doomed due to ecological cataclysm, but the Enterprise
has a way to fix it and save billions of lives. Captain Picard orders his
crew not to save the planet, because the people haven't discovered warp drive
yet.

Prime Directive episodes are usually absurd. Prohibited from intefering with
a primitive culture, the crew do it anyway, stealthily or undercover to
avoid being spotted. Then, they get spotted. The captain refuses to use the
ship's technology to immediately solve the problem, until the end of the
episode, when he does.

What's more, this idiocy is their _prime_ directive: Starfleet's Rule #1.
Respect for life, duty to scientific and personal truth, and exploring space
are directives #2-4 at best. No, Starfleet's primary goal is to twiddle
its thumbs when a a civilization is on the brink of destruction because
they haven't reached an arbitrarily defined tech level yet.

__Actual reason:__ Again, it makes perfect sense out-of-setting: the Prime
Directive exists as a plot device to create conflict:

> Thematically, it should be noted, the purpose of the Prime Directive was
> almost always about giving the protagonists something to rebel against:
> The Prime Directive says we shouldn’t do this, but we’re going to ignore
> it and save the day.

## Slightly more reasonable problems

Star Trek has a lot of overused plot devices, but the two above stand out
as completely ridiculous. Most of the time, there's some kind of internal
logic.

* Cloaking devices would allow Starfleet ships to avoid combat and
escape danger. Naturally, it's forbidden, because this would make for a
boring show. The Federation's ban on cloaked ships is lampshaded as a
term of their treaty with the Romulans, so it has a reasonable explanation.
* Data's superhuman strength and intellect would be extremely useful, if only
they could replicate the technology. But this has the same problem as genetic
engineering: you end up telling stories about a ship full of non-humans.
They successfully prevent this by proving the technology impossible to
replicate: Data's own attempt to create an android eventually fails, and
Picard refuses to let Starfleet reverse-engineer Data by arguing that it
interferes with Data's rights as a living being.
* They can teleport people down to the planet's surface, but can't beam them
back out when they're in trouble because "there's too much interference".
Obviously, the writers can't let the super technology solve their problems
instantly, but Voyager used this excuse so often that they ended up
inventing a new transporter trick so they could stop doing it.
* Time travel sure would solve a lot of problems, which is exactly why
the Federation can't have it. The main reason they don't is that it hasn't
been invented yet, and the few times they encounter time travel technology
it's usually because someone brought it back from the future.
