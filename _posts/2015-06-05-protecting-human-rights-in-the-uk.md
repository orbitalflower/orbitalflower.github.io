A few more things have been bothering me about Chris Grayling MP's anti-human
rights plan, the Orwellian titled "Protecting human rights in the UK":

In order to discredit the European Convention on Human Rights without also
discrediting his own party who led the treaty's creation in 1950, Grayling
argues that times have changed such that we no longer need it. The audacity of
this statement is staggering. It's like saying we no longer need a military
budget because there hasn't been a proper war for a long while.

Grayling goes on praise the rights enshrined in the ECHR, but criticizes the
EU's power to actually enforce those rights. Even though the UK has agreed to
these terms for decades, he is apparently so upset over relatively minor rulings
like prisoners' right to vote to threaten pulling the UK out of the EU
altogether.

__Note:__ It's doubtful that he's actually this petty: a more rational reason
is that GCHQ was afraid the EU would rule their domestic surveillance system to
be massively illegal. As Secretary for Justice, one of only two people
authorised to sign RIPA intercept warrants, Grayling would have been aware
of this; even if GCHQ concealed the nature of classified systems from him, he
would have been made aware of them after the Snowden disclosures. By the time he
published "Protecting human rights in the UK", __Grayling was aware of the
threat__ and began pushing ECHR immunity, ECHR withdrawal or EU withdrawal,
all solutions which would preserve GCHQ's surveillance capabilities.

He confidently states that the ECHR does not specifically guarantee voting
rights to prisoners because the authors intentionally left it out. But if the
authors were aware of the issue and intended to exclude prisoners from the right
to vote, they could easily have added such an exclusion to the treaty.

Grayling cites Germany as a country who declare the ECHR cannot overrule
their national law, giving Britain precedent can do the same. He fails to deduce
what follows, that other countries could use Britain as precedent to do the
same, leaving the ECHR powerless to force change in countries whose governments
abuse human rights; precisely the reason it exists.
